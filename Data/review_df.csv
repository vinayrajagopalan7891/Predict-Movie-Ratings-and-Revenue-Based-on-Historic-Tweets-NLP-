"4",4,"Excellent tween and teen movie!
Monte Carlo is a charming movie for tweens and/or teens. Several other reviewers disliked the movie calling it predictable and boring but I have to vehemently disagree. If you are looking for a cute, adventurous movie with NO SWEARING, NO NUDITY, NO SEXUAL SCENES or INNUENDOS, NO SMOKING, and NO DRUGS then this is the movie for you (and us!)! This movie reminds me of some of the 1960's Disney movies that were plot-wise too old for little kids but still 'safe' for the not quite teenagers.

This is a classic movie about mistaken identity and learning to get along. The 3 main characters in the movies are all very different personalities but they grow and learn to accept each other by the end of the movie. They also have very different 'happy endings' but seeing how different they are, the characters should end happily-ever-after differently.

There are some funny moments, some thinking 'would I do that?' moments, and some 'good for her' moments. You genuinely like each of these characters (except the mean girl) by the end of the show whether you liked them at the beginning or not.

This movie is perfect for its target audience of tweens/early teens and I wish more movies like this were available with today's stars!",5
"5",5,"Story/Screenplay: (4/5) A fun, lighthearted comedy with a few nonsensical scenes that diminished the overall story, but not enough to leave it unenjoyable.

Duration/Tempo: (4.5/5) At 1 hour and 49 minutes, it's an average length movie that felt short.  Good pacing for a playful, upbeat comedy.

Cast & Crew: (4.5/5) Selena Gomez and Leighton Meester were excellent.

Summary: (4.5/5) The story was very good, the cast was excellent, and the film felt short.  A strong thumbs up.",5

"8",8,"I know some might say this is a girly movie but Selena Gomez is a good singer and actress. It helps her case that during her Disney Channel tenure, she was considered one of the few genuinely good role models. Not that I was really into Disney Channel, even back then seeing how most of it is live-action sitcoms that tell you when to laugh although laugh tracks had already become old hat years ago. Anyway, Monte Carlo is formulaic and silly but it is still intermittently funny and Selena is charming in the lead role. I can't bring myself to hate this movie but I'm sure the principal demographic will be entertained.",3
"9",9,"I think people are way too critical in life. This movie is what it is. A feel-good, pass-time comedy with some beautiful moments. Nothing groundbreaking but definitely not horrible. It's a good film. Films are made to experience and I experienced it well without being critical of how simple the plot was. I knew how it would end, still enjoyed it. If there weren't films like these, life would be too serious. I recommend it to anyone who wants to spend a lazy weekend at home or having a sleepover with your girls.",4

(2012) 
PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMA/ THRILLER

  Written, directed and starred by Martin Donovan centering on a situation, he plays screenplay writer Robert Longfellow who upon coming home to visit his mother for reasons unclear.  But for the first 30 or 40 minutes into the film Robert revaluate old times including a publicized widowed actress who he still has feelings for.  And then his neighbor Gus (David Morse) who lives across the street from him takes him hostage.

 I liked the bonding scenes when Robert converses with Gus about how to become a successful screenwriter, but the ending is a real downer which the center character leaves viewers somewhat wanting to know more.

2 out of 4 stars",2
"18",18,"Fascinating character study, highlighted by strong performances from Martin Donovan and David Morse. Also written and directed by Martin Donovan, it's kind of stagey at times but ultimately quite satisfying.",3
"19",19,"Hm, this movie follows a path the viewer is not expecting, at least I didn't. It wasn't a good choice in my opinion, because in essence, the initial path until that moment, the first half of the movie, was an entertaining and interesting one. The character built-up was short, but effective, and the acting from both main character Robert (Martin Donovan) and loser Gus (David Morse) was very good. The mentioned choice for a no-win stand-off with the police instead of an interesting fling and movie idea with a hollywood hottie was a poor one. Sure, it had it's positive moments as well. For instance, it was at least a concious choice which the movie put all their effort in, leading to good and thought- provoking acting scenes. However, the police stand-off choice predominantly had a negative effect on the films quality. For instance, the many phonecalls that interrupted the whole thing and thereby the lacking the physical contact between those calling characters made it all feel a little fake and made-up. The worst thing: we didn't get to see what kind of relationship Robert had with his old flame or what his family meant to him. Nothing of that anymore, just a hurt wife and worried ex. Having said all that, I really need to say this movie was entertaining and good, just not an exceptional one.",4
"20",20,"excellent, i really enjoyed it.it's about this scumbag who takes a guy hostage who he bullied in scool and all he wants to do it drink with him.it' was pretty fucking funny.",4
"21",21,"I suspect that this is just one of those movies that is either loved or hated. But no one can deny that Michael Tully and his artist pals have created a truly odd movie that is as creepy as it funny. There is also something interestingly ""real"" about this ""family"" of men gathered together just off the back roads of American culture. Robert Longstreet is most especially brilliant as ""Ezra"" --- a performance that goes far deeper than the movie itself. Longstreet fully fleshes out an individual who has pushed his latent sexuality and his grief so far down into his psyche that he essentially not only taken on the role of ""mother"" --- but seems to be turning into a skewed version of who he perceived her to be. Beyond strange, twisted and unusual experiment within the very loose framework of a dark comedy always on the verge of attacking the audience. I consider this to be a must see film.",4
"22",22,"This film is bizarre and wonderful. The acting is phenomenal, and the characters are strange.  Robert Longstreet is a versatile and talented actor.  What is it about remote rural areas that is so haunting?  I suppose it is all the things that can be hidden there and kept secret for a very long time, only to return at the least expected moments, much like brother Cornelius.  Don't analyze it - the movie puts all its cards on the table.  Don't look for holes in the plot.  Just let the weirdness, the pain, and the healing wash over you.",4
"23",23,"An awkwardly good movie",4
"24",24,"There were some twisted minds that came up with this film. Fortunately, they did not push it too far. I was a tad worried as the opening scenes showed the artwork of Amos, which is some messed up stuff. The characters in this were totally original, the storyline is dark and so many scenes make you wonder if the film is going to turn a sinister corner att any minute. After all that anticipation, the ending was a bit of a let down but it has to be said, full marks for originality.",4
"25",25,"(*** 1/2): [img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/icons/icon14.gif[/img]

A very strange, original and funny film.",5
"26",26,"I was immediately drawn into the film  as the beginning credits were rolling because of the Bizarre yet Fascinating artwork that was featured. As I watched I realized they were painted by a main character the film surrounds itself around.
The art was genius in a sick kind of way.
The story focuses on 4 brothers who all have serious issues that slowly unfold as the film progresses.
One of the brothers returns after being gone for fifteen years and is welcomed back like it had only been a time span of six month or so.
I don't want to reveal much but it was billed as a Horror film ,I would not say it was in any kind of Horror Sub Genre but a mystery,Psychological drama with just enough Black comedy thrown in to keep it balanced. Listen very carefully to some of the dialogue and your jaw will drop plus there are a couple of scenes that are jaw dropping as well.
I was sucked in and even though it was quite slow paced I didn't even want to stop it for a bathroom break afraid I was going to miss the big payoff.
By the end you pretty much figure out what is and what isn't and the way they slowly slipped in pieces of the puzzle was subtly genius",5

It was way different then what I expected.It was weird & a waste of time & I was majorly disappointed",1
"30",30,"The description for this on TimeWarner, Sundance Channel, Free On-Demand claims that this is ""a mysterious horror movie"" and it hints at ""an act of revenge"" and that ""the town will never be the same.""

They only thing mysterious is how the person writing the description made the grievous error of typing ""horror"" when it should have said h ""horrible."" 

I would like to commit an ""act of revenge"" because I ""will never be the same"" for the 79 minutes of time I lost.

"31",31,"A chimpanzee can teach us the meaning of being human 
Director James Marsh helms the story of Chimpsky, a baby chimp separated from his mother and other siblings at a young age in 1973
Communicating with a chimpanzee became a landmark experiment and Stephanie Lafarge does just that just coming out of Columbus University 
Her daughter Jenny Lee even shared her insight on the whole experience 
It's rocky at first but that's all part of it; things like this take time to develop that special bond 
This documentary explores the language humans share with animals but with Nim it's all about establishing a relationship based on sign language 
Nim wasn't a pet but treated like an actual member of the family 
He could sense others feelings but also be kinda mischievous 
Yet as an animal he's still capable of going wild at any time, Nim would get temper tantrums and go on a rampage 
Nobody keeps a chimpanzee fit more than 5 years because they can be very unpredictable with their strength and behavior 
This ape would test the nature vs nurture hypothesis making headlines and media coverage
By the 1970s Nim's attitudes started to change drastically and extra precautions had to be taken 
Chimps are like us being very hedonistic 
The documentary is shocking, beautiful, awespiring, warm, and tragic 
There's a bond between man and animal that is fascinating to learn about despite all its shortcomings 
No one says it'll be easy as it takes patience, commitment, dedication, tolerance, and authority 
Nim is a unique case study because he's more than just a wild animal and shows how we all treat animals attempting to avoid the darker side of human nature",4
"32",32,"Movie made me angry.  The psychologist should have been caged.",5
"33",33,"An amazing documentary with a revolutionary true life study.  Quite heartfelt as well",5
"34",34,"Good but infuriating documentary. There's a deep irony in these humans trying to investigate an animal's capacity for higher functions while they themselves fail to plan or communicate properly or be self-aware. ",4
"35",35,"This movie is on like any other documentary, very intellectually simulating.",5
"36",36,"This was BEYOND sad.  I've never wanted to unwatch or unknow something so much.  It is a display of how terribly misguided academia can be and the pompousness of the professor?

I'll be sad for days.",1
"37",37,"Just trying to live together as though equally human is itself its own form of cruelty let alone the confinement & deprivation imposed on almost all undomesticated chimps held in captivity.

"38",38,"""ABSORBING | EXTRAORDINARY | HEART-BREAKING | INCREDIBLE | MAGNIFICENT"" (94-out-of-100)",5
"39",39,"On the surface, James Marsh's Project Nim, is about a group of people's quest to teach a chimp sign language. And if it was just about that, it probably would have been a great documentary. But it touches on so many other, very meaningful themes-most notably, abandonment and selfishness-that one can't help but admire the hell out of it. It's actually the film's human characters that ultimately come under Marsh's microscope, and what we see isn't pretty. It is, however, very powerful. I wasn't as enamored as many others were with Man on Wire, Marsh's previous feature, but Project Nim is sensational.

Nim Chimpsky is the name of the film's featured primate. He was born on a reserve but moved at a very early age to a Manhattan brownstone where he was to be raised as a human child in a classic test of nature vs. nurture. The experiment's administrator is Dr. Herb Terrace, but he stays hands-off for the most part, instead relying on several different research assistants and students to look after and raise the chimp. They begin teaching him sign language, and a great deal of progress is made (Nim dresses himself and seemingly mirrors the emotional growth of a human toddler).

Despite the obvious intelligence and self-awareness that Nim shows, he's not entirely able to give him his natural tendencies. He bites when he doesn't get what he wants, causing more than one caretaker to leave out of fear of getting hurt. This, in turn, causes him to be moved from his first home into a more secluded one, and ultimately from that home back to the reserve where he came from.

What's sad is that these people can't seem to grasp that Nim isn't a person. He doesn't know any better. Yes, he's smarter than most chimps, but he proves completely unable to create a coherent sentence, nor can he express anything that isn't a statement of want or need. Nim isn't a conversationalist, which was ultimately what Terrace was going for. But does the chimp's failure to comprehend mean he deserves to be completely abandoned? Of course not, yet that's what most of those who raised him do.

Politics, money, infighting, and some twisted personal morals and boundaries ultimately stop the formal experiment and serve as the catalyst for Nim's abandonment. Nim acts out, but not in such a way that he can't be looked after. At his reserve, he thrives in the care of a kindly and patient hippie. But he's visited only once by someone from his childhood-Terrace, who goes only to get pictures and video of him with the chimp. Watching Nim rejoice upon seeing him is tragic because we know how it will end. And seeing the way Terrace later writes Nim off because the experiment didn't play out the way he wanted it to is a little sickening.

Project Nim, unlike some of the year's other great documentaries, was shortlisted for the Academy Awards, but it was ultimately left off the final list of nominees. Marsh isn't a big name like Errol Morris or Steve James, but he's now made two very good-to-great documentaries in just three years. He also directed one of the Red Riding Trilogy films, and had a narrative feature (Shadow Dancer) debut to good reviews at Sundance this year starring Clive Owen and Andrea Riseborough. So in addition to being a fantastic film, Project Nim does something else: It puts all film writers on notice. Any list of the best working filmmakers (or promising up-and-comers) is incomplete without the name James Marsh on it.

"41",41,"It was rotten and it sucks",1
"42",42,"I usually don't condone any movies which feature talking animals but Kevin James is usually genuinely funny so I didn't hate this.  At the core it's a nice little romantic comedy wrapped in a somewhat annoying talking animal blanket. Pretty insane voice cast with Adam Sandler, Sylvester Stallone and Cher among others.  Rosario Dawson, Leslie Bibb, Joe Rogan and Donny Wahlberg make up the human cast. 
Harmless fun for the entire family.",3
"43",43,"Don't bother bringing the kids; the movie isn't intended to entertain them. It's a romantic comedy with the gimmick of talking zoo animals.

So how is it on its own merits? The plot is utterly predictable: boy falls in love with girl, girl rebukes him, years later they reconnect, boy finds girl doesn't suit him and he finds someone else he had known all along who was more his type. The zoo animals, who knew how to talk to humans all along but kept a code of silence, break it to talk to Griffin to help his love life because they like him so much, though their advice fails to help him in that regard. Only the gorilla ultimately provides real help to Griffin by helping to intercept his intended girl before she can leave him forever. There is some (but fortunately not excessive) scatological humor, and others that rely on pratfall comedy.

Overall: mildly entertaining for adults, but not really witty or exciting.",3

This is very important in a family film, because we don't usually sit through a full movie anymore, as most family movies are too baby for the kid, and yet most PG-13s (Chuck and Larry No No No) are just !!! and the kid will ??? and I have to, ""Pure male fantasy"" and the kid always ""I know that already!"".

I'm glad my kid likes video games more, and my nostalgia for these things is sure to peter out, but in the meantime--it's a cute, family film with Cher in her true form as a lioness, and Joe Rogan pre-Triggering and all Fear Factored out on the dance floor (if that hasn't been meme'd out it needs to be, 'cause Joe is posing up a storm like a true queen!).",5

My biggest issue, outside of the fact that it's not funny in the slightest, is that the voice acting for the animals was beyond horrific. They were times where it felt like they came into the studio drunk as many of the lines were mumbled and borderline incoherent. It's not even one of those ""bad movie night"" type of films, just one you should avoid at all costs",1
"48",48,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.

Kevin James and Rosario Dawson give a good carry, though they have an excellent range of supporting characters and then Adam Sandler as the voice of most of the animals.

While I would prefer him to lose his mind about the animals talking to him, we instead get a ""Do Little"" approach where Leslie Bibb and Rosario Dawson fight over a middle aged fat guy without big money.

However, not all the jokes land, with some being already outdated. The storyline itself also straddles the line between being too cliched and a self aware level of cheesiness. There is an attempt at satire here, but it doesn't succeed. Without thinking too hard, the film is perfectly enjoyable,

OK film that really shows many aspects of being a teacher. The placing of knowledge comes in some place after after morals, values and human emotions.

"98",98,"At its core, it's a story about coming to terms with severe grief from traumatic events, from the perspective of both adults and children, and how they can or should help each other. Written and directed with subtlety, 'Monsieur Lazhar' has an appropriately bleak feel to it and forgoes any sort of melodrama, opting instead to concentrate on capturing a, perhaps, more realistic version of events that unfurls in a natural manner. However, that also means that there were very few truly affecting scenes, bar one or two where raw emotion was on display.

Bryce Dallas Howard's character is despicable and Emma Stone is quite good as well, but the heavy lifting here is done by Viola Davis (who's final scene made me cry as well), and Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer, particularly when they're scene partners.

"141",141," (John Orrichio, 2009)

What continually amazed me, while I was watching the horrific , was that Alice and Carmine Orrichio, whom I assume are related to John Orrichio in some way (mom and dad? sister and brother-in-law?), were listed as producers on this film. What were they thinking? One would assume that Alice, at least, would have had some trouble with the storyline, which is misogynist in the extreme; this plotless mess of a movie exists for the sole purpose of showing non-consensual sex and the occasional gore scene, with a streak of not-too-well-buried racism a mile wide running straight down the middle. It's offensive in every possible way. And yet some of Orrichio's relatives were not only willing to bankroll it, but feed the cast and crew (Alice is also listed as the film's caterer). One can't help but wonder why there wasn't arsenic in the chicken salad sandwiches.

What little plot there is: Process, NJ, is a small town in the middle of pretty much nowhere whose economy is based on selling illegally-harvested organs, breeding babies for adoption, and selling sex slaves to rich overseas businessmen. (We are told early on that the development of the Internet has greatly facilitated their cashflow. Haw haw haw.) Needless to say, these things don't happen in a vacuum, so the town's bed and breakfast is a black hole from which overnight guests never emerge; men end up as organ donators, while women are either tortured into submission as sex slaves or consigned to the breeding farm, where the local studs (who are on the town payroll, of course) work night and day to impregnate them. All well and good, at least by Process standards, until they recognize there's a rise in demand for mixed-race babies. Coincidentally, Bella, a Brazilian pop star (Omaida Aponte) and Donny, her African-American bodyguard (S. Freddor), stop in town. After the usual struggle-knockout gas routine, she is sent to the breeding shed, while he is offered a stud position. He's less than impressed with the setup, but when his best friend Sam (In Her Shoes' Dan Rush) comes looking for them and ends up on the town payroll, Donny is convinced by Sam's suddenly-flush bank account, flashy new car, etc. Things start getting ugly when Donny realizes one of the girls he's required to service is Bella, and he tries to find a way to get both of them out of there, assisted by the one guy in town who also seems less than thrilled with the setup-the doctor who concocts the drugs used to keep the breeders sedated (Gerry Kirschbaum).

Simply put: one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the script is worthless, the camerawork is amateur. Even the soundtrack is risible, though it's by far the best thing about the movie. Perhaps the one thing Orrichio actually researched was Brazilian pop?  1/2",1
"142",142,"*SPOILERS* I bought this film from Amazon and I really liked it! I've read some really positive reviews and some negative ones as well, but being an indie film fan and a fan of previous John Orrichio films - I bought . The camera-work is his best yet with beautiful outdoor shots and disturbing lighting and effects that show how the town is twisted behind closed doors, but picturesque and normal to the outside world.

It's the story of a remote New Jersey small town that is not on any map. Basically the townsfolk kidnap unsuspecting tourists and sell them into slavery, they harvest their organs for sale on the black market or make leather goods out of them! Everything starts to unravel when an up & coming pop star from South America is kidnapped and her bodyguards come to town to find her. The whole town is in on the secret. The story is original and plays out well. The first 10 minutes are a little slow, but it picks up nicely from there.

As for the acting, Tony Rugnetta (Jacob) is excellent. His best role to date. Roberto Lombardi (Johnny) is perfect, convincingly evil & sexy at the same time! Christy Callas (Lilly) who is vulnerable & sinister at the same time and Gerry Kirschbaum (Doc) who has the cool demeanor of a Doctor with a hidden mania. Other notable performances are Deana Demko (Rosie) and Christina Sampson (Myrtle). There is rarely a stumble by any of the actors.

I also think that to truly enjoy this film you have to take it for what it is. A low budget, well made drama / thriller that is a little creepy, a little campy/funny and a little bloody. It's not a horror film per se and it's not for everyone. If you want the thrills of a Saw movie, pass on this. If you like Rosemary's Baby, this is right up your alley. The film has gotten bashed, but I believe that is coming from former colleagues of the film maker who are bitter. Judge for yourself!!",5

"151",151,"Very nice and stylish intro. Really foreshadows all the thrill and intensity that is to come from the movie. Pretty deadpan and dry humor, and I love it. ""The only thing I inherited was bad genes."" Lol. Poor guy is 5 foot 6 inches. Has to overcompensate by making lots of money so he can keep his hot blonde wife happy. Oh wow, so he's a disloyal and cheating prick? I guess I kind of saw that coming, that he was having an affair with some other broad. 

Interesting to watch how calculated and planned this guy's actions are. You have to be pretty clever and sly to pull off this kind of shit. Incredible how smooth the whole heist went. And I guess it helps tremendously when you work alongside a guy who works for the main security system that powers all the houses. Lmao it's almost comedic how short he is compared to all these giant Nords, including his wife who towers over him. This guy's smart though. The way he creates a profile of people of interest is really interesting to watch. 

Hmm, things are starting to get a little dicey. His life is about to get shaky now with this investigator guy that was on the news and the other handsome good looking guy that moved from the Netherlands. I have a feeling he might be in the art stealing business as well. Wow, so people just have expensive ass art hanging in their fucking apartments in Norway? I don't think he realizes what he's getting himself into. This Dutch guy was in the army and specialized in tracking people down. Shit, that's a pretty fucked way to find out your wife is having an affair. He was basically on the job. It's only fair since he's been having an affair with that brunette. Oh shit! What if this Clas guy played a trick on him, making him think that he is having an affair with his wife but in reality he's just trying to get inside his head and fuck with him? 

Holt shit, things are getting crazy! Roger ended up shooting Ove because he had an uzi in his hand and now Clas is tracking him. Bro! Lmao, I can't believe he had to hide in the huge pile of shit in the outhouse. Omg there was so much shit in there lol. This movie has a surprisingly dark and wild sense of humor. Watching him scramble around through the woods covered in dry shit was pretty hilarious. The way he impales the dog on the tractor and then busts through the barn doors still with the dog attached was a wtf moment lol. So funny those two fat twin cops. So crazy all the shit he had to put himself through. 

Holy shit what a cat and mouse shit show this has become! I don't know who to believe anymore! My man shot Lotte with his dick! I feel like she was in cahoots with Clas. This Clas guy has been toying with Roger this whole time, planning every move so that he can be two steps ahead of him. I love the way he breaks down in front of Diana and confesses how scared he's felt all along. It's even more impactful seeing how much of a new born baby he looks like - all bald with cuts and bruises. This is kind of like him reaching his height of enlightenment, being reborn in a sense. My only worry is that Diana is working alongside with Clas. I really hope that's not the case or else I would feel betrayal to the point of sickness. Poor Roger you almost can't help but feel bad for the guy. 

This movie teaches us that sometimes you have to go through hell and back just so you can realize that what you have, is enough. Roger was trying too hard to impress Diana with buying her things she didn't need which he used as a facade to hide behind. To hide his real insecurities about himself and about his relationship with Diana. Man, Diana was so pretty. In the end, he made things right with Diana and she even aided him in killing Clas.

Super cleverly and smartly written. The whole movie keeps you on your toes the whole time not knowing what to expect next and has a surprisingly dark and morbid sense of humor. Definitely a unique and odd thriller movie that's unlike any other thriller movie I've ever watched. Fantastic movie! I think I'd watch it again.",5

"169",169," isn't a bad movie by any means, but it's not on par with many of director Roman Polanski's better films.  It's immediately evident that the movie is based on a play as there is only one real set (a New York apartment) and four characters (played by Jodie Foster, John C Reilly, Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz).  The promising premise involves a schoolyard incident that results in two sets of parents meeting to discuss the matter.  What starts as an interesting exchange of ideas of how to resolve the issue degenerates into an ugly debate involving philosophy, morality, parenting, and marriage issues.

"185",185,"It took Glenn Close almost two decades to get Albert Nobbs to the big screen, and for such a talent to dedicate so much heart and soul to something, viewers have a right to expect something truly special, right? Well, if you go in with that mindset, you'll certainly be disappointed. However, those who can forget what they've heard about this film-both the good and the bad-and can just sit back and watch what unfolds are in for a nice time. Too often, Albert Nobbs falls into melodramatic traps, yet two stellar performances-including Close's-managed to keep my attention and interest long enough that I can give the film a solid recommendation.

Close plays the titular character, a hotel waiter in late-19th-century Ireland. Yes, that's ""waiter,"" not ""waitress."" Close plays a woman leading the life of a man. With no family, money, or real skills to fall back on, Albert decides his best chance to get ahead in life is as a man. No one he knows seems to think twice about his gender, with the exception of Hubert Page (Janet McTeer), a painter who discovers Albert's secret when staying in his room one night. Hubert, however, has something in common with Albert-he too is leading the life of a man, albeit for different reasons. But Hubert's story gives Albert hope. If he can lead a happy life and get married, so can Albert. So he sets his sights on the prettiest hotel maid, Helen (Mia Wasikowska), and decides he'll spend all the money he's saved on a storefront where he can sell tobacco. The only thing standing in his way is Helen's relationship with another-much younger and more passionate-hotel worker, Joe (Aaron Johnson).

Albert is a very tragic character. We sympathize with him because he so quietly goes about his business. Yet, it's always in the back of your mind that his dreams can't and won't become a reality-at least not in the perfect way he envisions them. Part of that has to do with Helen, one of the most vain women I've seen on film in some time. But the other part has to do with Albert himself. You get the sense that he's incapable of truly fighting for what he wants, and after Helen steps all over him the first, second, third time, it becomes clear the ending to this story won't necessarily be a happy one.

When the film focuses on Albert or Hubert it's quite successful. The politics of gender are generally glossed over. The appeal, rather, is on a more human level. Hubert, in particular, is a very vivid character. Seeing him come down a few pegs from his usual confident self late in the film is quite moving. I just wish we got more of him and less of Helen and Joe. Wasikowska and Johnson give subpar performances, and their melodramatic, on-again-off-again romance just distracts and pads the film's running time.

Glenn Close's Oscar chances will likely determine if people actually see this film. I'm 50/50 on whether she gets at this point, but it's hard to argue that she doesn't deserve a nod. She might not be the most convincing man, but she's a very convincing transgender. She has all the mannerisms down. What doesn't always work in her favor, however, is the screenplay, which is full of some clunky pieces of dialogue. I've already extolled the virtues of McTeer's work (she, too, could get a call on nomination morning). The other great piece in the acting trifecta here is Brendan Gleeson (coming off a sensational turn in The Guard), whose role is small but funny and definitely memorable.

Albert Nobbs features a very solid score and some good-looking sets. Ultimately, director Rodrigo Garcia (who you might be familiar with from 2010's Mother and Child) is more concerned with interpersonal dynamics than developing really resonant themes. And that approach certainly holds the film back to a degree. But despite that, I found myself taken at times with this story. I liked Albert Nobbs, perhaps more than I should have. It's far from groundbreaking, but it hits far more often than it misses.

Ullmann and Von Sydow play a married couple, living, mostly in isolation, on an island. Their country ends up caught up in a war, but it is not a war that they have any interest in or take any particular side in. But, eventually, their isolation fails them. The war comes to them. They find themselves brutalized by both sides - they are interviewed on television about attacks and their interviews are heavily edited and taken out of context. A man they believed was their friend shows up and forces brutal stark realities upon them. They eventually escape the island, but their relationship has been shattered, they are barely surviving and this is anything but a happy ending. Through the course of the film, they experience a role reversal--one has the strength of survival and the other is reduced to emotional escapism through dreams. Both will lose a measure of humanity, but one to a greater degree than the other.<U+200B>

Bergman's films are catnip to cinephiles, critics, and theatergoers partially because they inevitably flatter such audiences, offering tortured artists often nothing less than the great existential plight of humankind.

Max von Sydow in Skammen (1968)<U+200B>

<U+200B>
Liv Ullmann in Skammen (1968)

Von Sydow had been a star in Bergman's troupe for a decade before Ullmann came along and she would continue for years after he went to America, but here they play a married couple as naturally as if they were married. Perhaps that is part of the power of being in Bergman's regular troupe of actors - he writes roles so perfect and the actors know each other so well that it is easy for them to slip into the roles. That is the mark of a master and this is a classic that really doesn't deserved to be missed. Very glad I watched it .

The magnificent Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullmann in Ingmar Bergman's  (1968)",5
"208",208,"I never thought I would run across a Bergman film that necessitated an explosives coordinator, but here we are.

An unusual turn for the director, given that where normally he would have seemingly been content with incremental plot development, he instead substitutes a cataclysm. Ullmann's Eva and von Sydow's Jan are subject to a war about which very little is ever actually revealed, a civil conflict where the pair are caught in between shifting fronts and are forced to come to terms with just what they are willing to do or say in order to survive as unaligned civilians when human life suddenly loses value. 

In some ways, it's difficult to ignore how Bergman almost romanticizes suffering in this film, focusing on an artistic, expressive couple whose worldly desires are charmingly straightforward, such as a bottle of wine after dinner, and then reducing them to practically and morally impoverished circumstances in incremental fashion. Characters slipping into somber depressions, fully embracing the near-certainty of impending death with hardly a whisper. But while it is not necessarily completely original territory, the story does still wield power, giving the quiet moments (whether due to cowardice, resignation, or murderous certainty) as much respect and gravitas as the periodic outbursts. (4/5)",4
"209",209,"This war drama is another impressive addition to Bergman's large body of films. Though some of the themes it boasts (dehumanization) aren't the most original for the genre, I really appreciated the way it handled this aspect. The various struggles that Eva and Jan experienced influenced their connection to each other and their willingness to commit heinous acts to survive. Early on in the film, for example, Jan was unable to kill a chicken, but later developed the stomach to kill another person. By contrast, while Eva was more sympathetic, Jan's actions lead to her despair and her feeling of disconnection from him later on. While the characterizations were effective though, I was mainly drawn to how the film appeared to be anti-war. For instance, we never learn what war was going on in the film. It might as well be a fictitious war. We also don't learn much about why the war is going on. Given the lack of insight over those details, Bergman didn't appear to glamourize either side. While the invading forces obviously caused problems for the two protagonists and other people around them, the army on their side wasn't depicted in a positive light either. In addition to a couple scenes of the soldiers mistreating their own citizens, Col. Jacobi also took advantage of and used Eva and Jan for his own purposes, just like the invading forces who interviewed the couple did. For the most part, I really loved this film, though I wasn't sure what to make of the ending sequence. While it contained some of the most horrifying imagery in the film, the tonal jump from war drama to survival thriller felt like a strange culmination to the film's themes. In spite of that, I really enjoyed my time with this film.",4

They both evolved throughout the conflict to do things they wouldn't have done it beforehand.  It was tragic and it was a surprising reminder of the horrors of tyranny and anarchy.  It was on YouTube.",4
"211",211,"Ingmar Berman's  may be the most depressing, somber, and political film of Bergman's lengthy oeuvre…and that is saying something.  Jan (Max von Sydow), an emotionally and physically fragile man, and his apolitical wife Eva (Liv Ullmann) operate a small farm on an isolated island in an effort to escape a civil war raging on the mainland.  Their willful ignorance is a way of living in a world of love instead of a world of conflict.  However, their slowly deteriorating relationship is eventually infringed upon by the war they are trying to escape.  Sven Nyquist's gorgeous cinematography is the eye through which we watch the horrors.  This is a powerful film (the final scene is devastating) that is somehow always overlooked when examining Bergman's massive body of work.",5
"212",212,"Very bleak, even for Bergman, and hauntingly beautiful.",5
"213",213,"A gritty realistic depiction of a couple struggling to survive in a war.

Ingmar Bergman's  (1968) is a dark and depressing war drama that centers around a single Swedish couple desperately trying to live through warfare.  works such terrible wonders as it's not really a war film, but rather an imagining of a romance drama during the war.

For Bergman, all war is condemned in . The violence is sudden, explosive, and thundering. The incessant gunfire, nonstop bombardment, and brutal punches all feel harsh and painful still in . They are merely the backdrop to a failing marriage brought to ruination and misery by the oppressive government presence with their wartime powers. The abuse of government soldiers alongside the lead characters' sadness makes  profoundly sorrowful and melancholic.

The characters of  feel destroyed emotionally to begin with, and the war only weakens their strength into enraged dejection. Bergman's script is stark and bleak thematically with biting dialogue that only a intimate couple could speak to each other to cause such pain. Bergman's writing is sincere and gives you pause as you contemplate the agony and loneliness both leads feel. Bergman makes you hate war and sympathize with the families broken by conflict.

Liv Ullmann is tender and endearing as Eva Rosenberg, while simultaneously displaying a sorrow and unhappiness so deep that you feel empty watching her performance. She is resplendent as Eva. Ullmann understands how to convey melancholy with her hurt eyes and distressed face. She is outstanding opposite Max von Sydow.

Sydow is excellent as Jan Rosenberg. His exhausted expression of defeat is cinematic perfection. Sydow plays Jan with a quiet malcontent . His despondency is further delved into by his annoyance at Ullmann's Eva's pestering and complaints. His perpetual gloom is entertaining and devastating at the same time. There is a silent desolation in  in how open and sparse  looks and feels. The roles from Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow ground you in that despair.

Similarly, Gunnar Bjornstrand is so sleazy and affable as Col. Jacobi. You hate his power dynamic over the Rosenberg's, but can only watch helplessly as Jacobi meets his fate.

I have to hand it to Sven Nykvist's cinematography. The close zoom ins to faces and wide shots of bare spaces are impressive. The hollow feeling that Nykvist captures with his camera work is harrowing to endure, but awe inspiring to witness. I love the cold look of . He makes everything look hopeless to match Bergman's depressing tone.

 is for people that want or need to see how tragic war is for those affected directly by warfare on land.  follows an ordinary couple, who lives are ravaged by war as is their land and personalities. There is no peace of mind or tender hope in . There is only embarrassment and  for Ingmar Bergman's characters in their own pathetic cowardice and inability to act.

(I could go on and on). The film remains upright because of the masterful atmosphere that it creates. I really enjoyed Alberto Iglesias's score and thought it had a few brilliantly judged moments tailormade (pun intended) to plunge you even further into the events on screen. Oldman's Smiley is the best protagonist that the story could ask for, a man combining an apparent dullness with an underlyingly difficult air of mystery.

The movie has a similar feel to the 1980s movie ‘Over the Top' which depicts the drifter lifestyle of a father that reconnects with his son and has themes of believing in oneself, but flips the script from a caring father to an uncaring one. As the name suggests the movie is about authenticity, heart and rooting for the underdog and the amount of empathy that one starts to feel for the robot Atom actually puts the Transformers franchise to shame. What elevates Real Steel slightly above your average robot movie is that the teaching of Atom using the ‘shadow function' reminds us that we are similar to robots in that we have to learn through mimicking examples and receiving feedback. The movie concludes not by pinning everything on a win or lose situation like the father Charlie typically does, but instead presents the viewer with a different perspective which is that ultimately there are other victories to achieve.

I love many many moments in this film. The looks between actors, the lines which feel improvised, these pieces of a life. And then the boldness where the story goes was such a refreshing surprise given the itty-bitty bits with which it was built, and the step-by-step progression. It was a joy to blast into another world, and yet it still feel earned... Michelle Williams is wonderfully exacting in her naturalness. Rogen is almost unlikable, an achievement. And Kirby (who apparently doesn't age - see, T.M.Mrs.Maisel) as the handsome Rogen 2.0 is compelling in his easy charm. It's a personal film. Hearkens to the work of Mike Leigh.

"258",258,"I'm intrigued by 50-50 movies. Half of the critics pan them; the other half think they're worthy of praise. The Woman in the Fifth is one of those. I find that when a movie is divisive, it's usually rewarding to watch. 
Watch this one.  
Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski has adapted Douglas Kennedy's remarkable novel The Woman in the Fifth, and he has remained largely faithful to the novel's dreamlike mood, creepiness, and paranoia. The Paris in which the protagonist finds himself in is not the Paris of tourists, but the seedy underside. It's absorbing to look at. This is one of those films that is so rich in detail and nuance that it can be analyzed scene by scene.
Tom (Ethan Hawke) is an American writer who has published one good novel but is now doing the university lecture circuit as he tries to start a second one. He arrives in Paris to reunite with his estranged wife and his little girl. But due to a past transgression for which he was imprisoned (detailed in the book but not the film), his wife refuses to see him, calling the police when he knocks on her door. He sees his daughter briefly outside on the sidewalk, but since the cops are enroute, he runs and jumps on a bus. Falling asleep after his long flight, he awakes at the end of the bus line to find that his bags and wallet have been stolen.
Stumbling into a scroungy café, he meets the owner and tells him what happened. The owner agrees to rent him a room on credit, if he agrees to take a strange job. He is to sit in a room nearby for six hours every night. The room has a desk, a chair, a video screen from a security camera, and a keypad. His job is to watch the screen and, if the visitors know a certain key word, he is to buzz them in on the keypad, allowing them access to the people next door. Tom asks questions, but is just told to do the job and he will earn 50 euros a night. Not having a lot of choice, Tom takes the job. He befriends a young waitress from the café (Joanna Kulig), and more significantly, he meets Margit (Kristin Scott Thomas), the mysterious Woman in the Fifth, at a literary gathering. Is she real? Is she a male fantasy? The way she caters to him sexually, we suspect the latter. But she's not an apparition; she's flesh and blood. Right? 
Tom figures on using his nightly six hours to work on his next book, but instead, he ends up writing long letters to his daughter. He tries to enlist the aid of a law firm to help him get custody, but he can't afford the legal fees. He's trapped, frustrated. Outside the law firm, he stands on the sidewalk and screams. He sneaks around to get glimpses of his daughter at the playground, where he can have short conversations with her.  
Meanwhile, his relationship with young waitress turns into an affair. Not a good idea: She's his landlord's girlfriend. 
There is no need to synopsize any further. Just be ready for some strange and portentous goings on. The ending surprised me. Maybe you will see it coming. I guess I'm a bit slow, but I didn't.
But aside from the plot, film connoisseurs will appreciate the way Pawlikowski uses a camera. He creates an atmosphere of unease and mystery by interspersing seemingly unrelated shots with those of Tom: Strange looking bugs crawl up the rough bark of a tree. A stoic owl stares at us. We begin to wonder about Tom's sanity.
I've often wondered how autobiographical Kennedy's novel is. Hawke even resembles him physically. He is absorbing in his film. Not that he's such a wonderful guy. We know little about him, other than the fact that he loves his child and wants to see her. And he obviously has issues with women. Still, we sympathize with him as a victim who is drawn into dark circumstances beyond his control. Hitchcockian, for sure. But maybe he's not so innocent.",4

"260",260,"Pawlikowski's tones in his films are very nice, having seen this and ""Ida."" This film just never effectively focuses on any of the characters or themes it introduces though. At first, it's about the daughter, then it's about the woman in the fifth, then it's about the girl in the hotel / cafe. I'm not sure what worked here, which is a shame since a film featuring Ethan Hawke as an estranged Father or a once successful writer usually is great, and he's both in this!",2

There is no final resolution or clarification of what has gone on or what is going on. As that being said for this being a unlikely not good film, I give ""The Girl In The Fifth"" a D.",2
"263",263,"Fundamentally, The Woman in the Fifth brings nothing new to cinema but nonetheless displays the artistic brilliance of director Pawel Pawlikowski. The film centres around Ethan Hawke as a Tom who tries to gain custody of his daughter whilst writing a novel in Paris. Pawlikowski utilises different motifs to show the inward struggles and compelling emotions the characters deal with. For some, the film can feel rather bland and the last third can feel especially slow. The Woman in the Fifth overall is an interesting film but it's nothing remarkable.",3
"264",264,"""The Woman in the Fifth's"" leading character clearly struggles in the deciphering of the lines that separate fantasy and reality, but to untangle the mess that is his psyche is a bore I'd rather not stress myself out with extricating.  Because the film, written and directed by Pawel Pawlikowski, is the sort of pretentious art house dreck that gives so much weight to that godforsakenly overused cinematic device better known as ambiguity that forgotten is the more intriguing mood enhancer better known as intrigue.  It's a low-rent version of ""The Tenant,"" only the horrors aren't so cutting and Pawlikowski, unlike Roman Polanski, is too indirect, too flighty, to ensure that his mysteries provoke instead of tire.
	In the movie, Ethan Hawke stars as Tom Ricks, an American novelist who may as well be the living embodiment of a person down on their luck.  Though supposedly recovered from a mental illness that took away the stability of the last few years, he's otherwise psychologically floating and severely depressed.  When we first meet him, he's just moved to Paris to be closer to his ex-wife (Delphine Chuillot), who despises him, and their elementary-aged daughter, who's in the dark regarding why she hasn't seen her father in so long.  The jump to France is his only hope to reconnect with the family he's lost touch with, but days into his stay does he find that not a fragment of hope lingers in the air.
	Broke and desperate, he takes a night guard job at a seedy hostel, which pays decently for an occupation that requires him to do so little.  It's ideal for a man of his caliber (his only task is to push a button to let people through one of the building's covert entrances), and the possibility of having ample time to write could potentially help him piece his life back together.
	But things begin taking bizarre - and growingly unsettling - turns when he starts having an affair with an elegant widow (Kristin Scott Thomas).  Only willing to meet at five pm twice a week in her chic apartment, with no questions to be asked about her personal life, the woman gives as much new meaning to Tom's existence as it brings inexplicable tragedy.  Whether she's a figment of his imagination seems highly likely - her manner of speech, her enigmatic actions, seem staged, planned - but to declare if such a conclusion is based in fact would spoil the fun of ""The Woman in the Fifth.""
	Or maybe it wouldn't, since the film is decidedly lacking in charge and is cryptic to the point of being baffling.  Though Hawke's performance is skillful, delicately sympathetic and noticeably affected by something unknown, little else about the film is as easy to grasp as what Tom might be feeling at this particularly hard time in his life.  The titular force of glamour is sketched too thinly to provide any sort of emotional attachment (but the lithe Scott Thomas is a sensation no matter the role), and the movie's storyline, either characterized as a character study or a horror film (?), is always swimming, never to be made compelling.
	Obvious is Pawlikowski's dedication to earlier pictures immersed in their focusing on a character's going insane - we can see shades of ""Repulsion"" and ""Hour of the Wolf"" here, however watered down they are - but he's too reliant on understated metaphors, on unseeable hidden meanings, to inspire any kind of reaction from even the most dedicated of a viewer.  Its eighty minutes drag until we've concluded that it claws its way to the finish line rather than passing an interesting breaking point.",2

"280",280,"While Friends with Kids mostly conforms to the classic story of best friends gradually discovering they're in love with each other throughout the movie, the film makes this cliche trope slightly more entertaining with the added element of the two characters raising a child together. However, the compatibility of Jason (Adam Scott) and Julie (Jennifer Westfeldt, who also wrote, directed, and produced the film) is undermined by the fact that Jason is almost unbearable. His constant comments that objectify and demean women are disgusting. In fact, his best moment is the dinner table scene when he yells at Ben, played by Jon Hamm, to stop being so judgemental. Ben is also horrible, but he is supposed to be horrible and the audience is supposed to hate him. Jason is supposed to be one of the characters that the audience is rooting for, but I found myself wishing that Julie would end up with Kurt, despite the fact that anyone who has ever seen a romcom knows that this other man will eventually disappear, just like Megan Fox's character, Mary Jane. 

While Mary Jane is also far from likable, this is mostly because she seemed to have zero personality. Her appearance was commented on numerous times by many of the characters, but she lacked any character development that could have made her tolerable. The idea of villainizing a woman who does not want to have kids also feels stale and outdated. 

Besides Julie, Leslie (Maya Rudolph) and Alex (Chris O'Dowd) were by far the most likable characters. However, this is mostly because they were uninvolved with the plot. Although they did have a micro-story arc about finding passion in a relationship after having kids, they were mostly just bystanders as the drama unfolded. Despite their small roles, Rudolph and O'Dowd were both hilarious in their roles, particularly Rudolph. She stole many of the scenes she was in and provided the most genuinely funny material. 

Overall, the film is good. Not outstanding but certainly better than some of its romcom peers that are either completely cliche or just an hour and a half of crass jokes that aren't very funny. It presents a compelling message about romance, suggesting that it does not always have to be based on passion or sexual attraction. It recognizes the hardships of parenthood and does not pass judgement on imperfect parents.",4

"300",300,"Greta Gerwig plays Violet, a modern day Jane Austen-like heroine, busying herself by fixing the lives of those around her on an waspish east coast university. Our introduction to Violet and her group of campus friends is by way of Analeigh Tipton, playing a new girl Lily, who the group takes under their wing.

Violet: Hello! Are you a new student?
Lily: Yes.
Violet: Good, we thought so. We'd like to help you.

The story follows Violet and her group of friends on an elite fictional university (they don't have a greek system, they use a roman system for sororities and fraternities) where they run a suicide prevention group. 

Violet: I don't really like the word ""depressed"". I prefer to say I'm in a tailspin.

But enter a plethora of handsome, dumb boys to stir things up between the group members. 

Heather: [to Lily] Speaking of suicide prevention, do you have a boyfriend, Lily?
Rose: Are you dating anyone?
Lily: I don't see the connection.
Heather: You don't?
Violet: Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.

The witty, urbane, bourgeois character who populate writer/director/producer Whit Stillman's films typically either delight or annoy audiences, and for me, I absolutely adore Stillman's films (""Metropolitan"" ""Barcelona"" ""Last Days of Disco""). With ""Damsels in Distress"" Stillman is quoted as saying he wanted to write a film about ""four girls in a dorm who are trying to keep things civil in an uncivil world"" and think that is a nice summary of this film's tone. 

Violet: We're also trying to make a difference in people's lives, and one way to do that is to stop them from killing themselves.

The girls are an effortlessly likable group, particularly Gerwig and Tipton, who all are a delight to listen to as they banter amongst themselves and with others. Charming exchanges include:

Heather: Doar dorm has the university's highest fatality rate as well as the worst hygiene.
Lily: Highest suicide rate.
Violet: No, the highest fatality rate. It's not certain what percentage were intentional and how many were just due to a temporary unawareness of gravity's laws.

Or

Violet: We get a lot of students coming to the center pretending to be depressed to get the donuts.
Rose: Confidence tricksters!
Violet: Yes, it's really bad, really cynical. And we made a pledge the donut company that we would only give the donuts to students who were depressed, suicidal or otherwise nutty. We're a non-profit, so the rules are pretty strict.

Or 

Violet: I took the commuter train to Villa Franka and I checked into a cheap motel there.
Rose: The Motel 6?
Violet: No, the Motel 4. It's even less expensive.
Rose: The Motel 4, in Villa Franka? My god, you really were suicidal.

I'll fully admit that Stillman's mannered dialogue is not for all tastes, but I love the clever banter, witty observations, and particularly the verbal sparring, where characters try to prove they're the smartest one in the room. If that sounds like a good time to you, this film is a delight. For others, it may be an endurance test.",5

Damsels In Distress

Surprisingly it is flat out hilarious and offers the audience their life of the time throughout the course of time and keeps them engaged throughout the course of it by only walking on something that it is so narrow yet is explored in detail with such an elegance and confidence that it is almost impossible not to be effected by it. The screenplay is gripping, thought-provoking and of ironic nature, all along its well edited and of almost 100 minutes. The camera work is utterly beautiful and is shot nicely too but unfortunately is short on other technical aspects especially on sound department. Whit Stillman; the writer-director, has done a tremendous work on executing the anticipated vision on screen by keeping it light and breezy. Greta Gerwig is amazing on her portrayal and is supported well by her cast and the key to that is the chemistry among them which is more convincing than any other thing. Having said that, the feature chews off too much of the subplots of the characters only to make a definite point which the audience can see far before it even hits, which makes it redundant.

Also note that Conleth Hill (very funny as Mcgregor's boss) unfortunately disappears from the film early on. By contrast, the romantic comedy wasn't terribly compelling despite the strong work from the two leads, partly because of the distraction of Mison's soldier character. Plus, although I like the idea of the power of faith overcoming skepticism, it might have worked better if the central scheme didn't appear to be a wasteful extravagance of a super-rich official in a very poor country (there must be better ways to spend 50,000,000 pounds!).

"335",335,"An endearing romance with a delightfully strange premise.

Lasse Hallstrom's Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (2011) is a sweet romantic comedy. Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt are very funny and sweet together. Their chemistry and the hilarious dialogue makes this a fun lighthearted film.

Hallstrom's direction is straightforward with a penchant for some beautiful shots and scenery. The scene when Ewan McGregor cuts his hand on the lure he named for Emily Blunt's character from gripping it too hard is an example one a great visual metaphor from Hallstrom. Hallstrom makes Salmon Fishing in the Yemen a light breeze of a movie to watch whenever you feel down for a quick pick me up.

I do feel that the plot points for the Afghanistan War are clunky and awkwardly placed in here as a misguided attempt at a moral parable. I think this movie would have been just fine without the political commentary as the social commentary on emotional connections in relationships is enough of a reason for this story. The Middle Eastern dissent felt hackneyed and contrived. The rest of the romantic comedy elements are great however!

Ewan McGregor is fantastic as a fussy Scottish government worker and fishing advocate roped into an assignment he does want, while he also plays the dissatisfied husband and goofy new love interest well. McGregor ups his Scottish accent perfectly for even more humor and endlessly adds in funny quips to entertain the viewer.

Emily Blunt is excellent as a steadfast assistant to a ludicrously wealthy sheikh. Her stern, but fun loving character is immediately likable. Her desire for a nice and present man will resonate with audience members, while her devotion to a man she's only known for 3 weeks will confound others. I like Blunt, especially how she foils McGregor's prudish and awkward lead with an open and warm manner. She's very sweet and endearing in Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.

The entire premise of transporting salmon for a rich sheikh to fish as his private river is funny enough. When put together with strange and unique characters, you have a nice little indie film that is thoroughly entertaining.

Kristin Scott Thomas is hilarious as the commanding press chief to the Prime Minister of England. Her yelling and authoritative presence is humorous and her little eye rolls and sly remarks are equally joy inducing.

I like Conleth Hill as McGregor's overlord boss and immediate superior with a superiority complex. He is hilarious next to McGregor and was a great casting choice. Likewise, Rachel Stirling is outstanding as McGregor's dissatisfied wife. All her subtle choices display a clear sadness and unhappiness with her marriage. She is sublime opposite McGregor.

Overall, this is a short and sweet romantic comedy like fans of this genre dream of I'm sure. If you can ignore the melodramatic serious portions, the rest of the movie is a riotous treat.",4

Biographical productions, not always result in exceptional films, in most cases the focus totally dedicated to one character makes it difficult to work creatively important aspects such as direction and screenplay.

Often follows a simplistic scheme where everyone who gets the spotlight is the protagonist, and thus, all other features are now in the background.

At this point the biopic soccer player  de Freitas is no exception to the rule. Rodrigo Santoro owns the film, and thus, """" is nonetheless a cinematic experience incomplete.

That said, we have here one of the best performances of recent years in film from Brazil. The 's Santoro is multifaceted as real human beings, capable of provoking sympathy and contempt almost simultaneously.

The content quite heavy and often tragic - because we have here the classic trajectory of rise and fall of a phenomenon leaks - does not prevent Santoro to shine in every scene, whether in moments of euphoric jingoism of fame, or the deepest depression brought the disease.

It remains to warn that this is not a production for those who are looking of what is fun and exciting in the world of football, but in some reflection on arrogance towards life, as most of the films that revive superstars.

That one scene alone is perplexing in many ways in the form of necessity, structure, acting, editing, story, original story with willingness, deception and many other emotions being conjured up. It is also one of the more maddening scenes in film history which is directly attributed to the character of Amy Sumner (Susan George) and her definition of loyalty.

"391",391,"This biopic about the first wife of iconic and legendary South African statesman and apartheid adversary Nelson Mandela, stars Academy Award winning actress Jennifer Hudson (Dreamgirls) as the title character who was raised in a strict, rural upbringing with a schoolteacher father who was disappointed with the fact that she was his sixth daughter.  Winnie worked hard to win his approval and when she was of age she moved to the city to pursue medical school -- which was unusual in a sexist, apartheid South Africa.  It was here that she met (and almost reluctantly) fell in love with the young political revolutionary Mandela (Terrence Howard - Hustle & Flow) who was already an ""enemy"" of the white government for believing in equality.  The film is rather shaky in that it doesn't really appear to know what it wants to tell us about Winnie and while an Oscar-winner (in a good performance with one STELLAR, knockout scene), Hudson does appear to have a limited acting range.  After Nelson is arrested and incarcerated, Winnie also faces some horrible and unjust, inhumane abuses at the hands of the South African government and once she is freed she attempts to carry his mantle but does so with some very questionable actions that have today tainted her legacy.  The film perhaps wants to be overly honest but in doing so Winnie doesn't come across as a winning figure for such a biopic.  Different time ... different place.

If you saw a trailer, read the synopsis, or even made a rough guess based on the title, I’m betting you could come pretty close to guessing what this movie delivers. It’s the kind of script that I could see a screenwriter inventing even if an actual tail-less dolphin didn’t exist as the basis for their story. The most interesting element of Dolphin Tale is definitely the fact that Winter is a real dolphin and has actually dealt with the problems dramatized in this movie. Of course, the movie wants to focus on a character who can talk, so instead the plot is more about a young boy who wants to help save this injured dolphin. It’s the “Free Willy” formula, and apparently it works for most people because this was a box office success. But the sad truth is that basically every detail of this film is a fabrication used to make a Hollywood story out of a unique animal that could be inspiring on her own. Once I forced myself to ignore the discrepancy between reality and Dolphin Tale, I was able to get some enjoyment from it. It’s hard not to be affected by the tug on your heartstrings when a movie is about a struggling boy who finally finds passion in his life. And, of course, that impact is increased by the fact that a crippled dolphin is part of that story. While most of this movie was overflowing with cliché, I did appreciate that it avoided going straight down every obvious pathway. There was one particular event that I expected from early on in the film, and I was surprised the movie never went there. Probably the most annoying aspect of Dolphin Tale is the trope of the aquarium running low on funds and needing to find a way to stay open. It was one additional layer of conflict that the movie didn’t require. I can appreciate Dolphin Tale for what it is, and could even recommend it for family entertainment, but I also wish I could just watch a documentary about how Winter was truly saved.",3

"419",419,"Accidents Will Happen - The Queer Rearview:  <U+2605><U+2605><U+2605><U+2605><U+2605>

While everyone else has picked apart the differences between the Snyder and Whedon cuts of  the Justice League films, this film nerd spent 5 1/2 hours poring over the two versions of a little seen film from 2005 which went from fascinating 2 1/2 hour mess to out and out masterpiece on its journey to writer/director Kenneth Lonergan's 3 hour extended cut, which finally surfaced in 2011.  

Just a few years after 9/11, Lonergan (You Can Count On Me, Manchester By The Sea)  captured a New York City still on edge, when a glance at a jet in the sky still triggered a fearful response. In such an environment, we meet Lisa Cohen (a then 23 year old, pre-True Blood Anna Paquin), a petulant student at an elite prep school who seems to thrive on coming in hot during any debate with a classmate when she's not crushing on her teacher Mr. Aaron (Matt Damon).  It's clear from the outset that Lisa, who lives with her single mother Joan (J. Smith-Cameron), a stage actor on the brink of success, and her younger brother, thrives on drama, anger, and a general feeling that the world revolves around her.  

On one of her whims, she decides to go shopping for a cowboy hat in anticipation of an upcoming ranch vacation with her L.A.-based father Karl, played with low key assurance by Lonergan himself.  Out of nowhere, she notices Maretti (Mark Ruffalo) who has a pretty cool hat on as he drives his bus past her. Trying to stop him, they have enough semi-flirtatious exchanges to distract him and cause a terrible accident.  Without spoiling anything, the victim, an Academy Award winning actor, makes an unforgettable impression with just a couple of minutes screen time. Lisa, so disturbed by the aftermath, spends the remainder of the story seeking out some sort of justice for the victim. 

What could have easily descended into a dull, tv movie, turns out to be a way ahead of its time indictment of virtue signaling, entitlement, racial and class privilege, and unfettered self-involvement. With several scenes restored, and the Robert Altman-esque technique of overhearing multiple conversations at once, Lonergan's point, that we have all, at times, wrongly felt that our story is the most important one, gets strongly underscored with his cut. With motivations unclear or out of nowhere in key moments of the original, Lonergan fixes those issues and has produced a clear, sometimes meandering, but powerful, emotionally wrenching experience. 

Said meandering, in fact, enhances the storytelling, forcing you to focus on the subtext rather than the tried and true legal machinations. We watch Lisa lose her virginity is a cringe-worthy but somehow touching sequence. A very young at the time, John Gallagher Jr. will break your heart when getting dumped by Lisa. Matt Damon, whose character didn't make a lot of sense in the original cut, brings a palpable awkwardness to his many scenes with Lisa. Paquin, who I feel has never been better, takes her characterization way over the edge, fearlessly ignoring or not caring that she comes across as a spoiled brat. She never hesitates to shout over anyone, not caring a whit about anyone's perceptions of her. She has a long way to go towards behaving like an adult, and this film never pretends that a magic bullet exists to get her there. 

Adding to the maturity of this work, this cast, stacked with such accomplished names as Matthew Broderick, Kieran Culkin, Jean Reno, Allison Janney, Michael Ealy, and Jeannie Berlin, along with those aforementioned, help create a vast, specific world for Lisa to inhabit. In a career-best performance, Berlin in particular galvanizes with her prickly, outspoken, Emily, a close friend of the victim who refuses to let Lisa inflict her immaturity on her without repercussions.  Emily describes the victim as impossible to get along with, but watch her tear apart her supposed best friend Dave (Michael Ealy) with aggressions, micro-aggressions, and flat out insults, and you're bearing witness to a layered, difficult supporting character we rarely get to see. Emily is the center of her own story, and damned if she's gonna let Lisa knock her off her perch. The scene in which she cuts loose on the teen is an instant, 16 years in the making classic. An Oscar nominee for 1972's The Heartbreak Kid, Berlin, after a long break,  has delivered astounding performances in recent years, none more so than her Oscar-worthy turn here. 

J. Smith-Cameron, who has gone on to memorable turns in Succession and Search Party, and is married to Lonergan, also gives a fantastic performance as Lisa's insecure but adventurous mother. Typical films about teens don't tend to explore the sexuality of its parents, but her Joan has complexity, nuance, and an endless amount of justified frustration. 

, a name in an important poem read in the middle of the film, failed at the Box Office upon initial release in 2011, after 6 years of legal battles. It's a terrible shame for a film which has finally found its rightful placement as truly great. If you're looking for more action, more CGI, more capes, then you know where to go. But flip through the same streaming service if you want something confrontational, rough, and a truly seminal look at a teen you haven't seen before.",5

I don't think I've ever had this experience before: that of a film bringing both the philosophic depth and emotional rawness first expressed in but a few lines of verse to such wonderful life on screen. It was a revelation the likes of which I certainly never expected.  is what movies might be if they ever grew up and became films. My tears were elicited, even inspired; not jerked. Lonergan's  is truly breathtaking, and Anna Paquin is a magnificent actress. I am most anxious for her to be the kind of actress that has more parts like Lisa Cohen, the same kind of parts that Margo Channing was for Bette Davis and Norma Desmond was for Gloria Swanson … but now, while she's still youngish. I thought she was amazing in True Blood and Fly Away Home, but other of her appearances have frankly not risen to the height of 's Lisa Cohen — not, let me assure you, Anna, because of any acting misstep by you.

What a story, what a corrupt world. How did Brugger get out alive? This is an amazing look into a society and way of life you could not imagine much less make up. There are some really slimy people in the world and this film finds them under every rock.",4
"436",436,"As a film, The Ambassador is fascinating. Danish provocateur/journalist Mads Brügger embeds himself in the dangerous and twisted world of the African business diplomat. With sketchy, black market credentials, the character he's playing moves from Monrovia, Liberia to Bangui, Central African Republic in search of blood diamonds but under the pretense of building a third-world-saving match factory.

The real Brügger, it seems, wants to expose the actual men who participate in these abhorrent transactions, but at what cost? The film admirably addresses the moral quagmire it finds itself bogged down in by calling attention to the men who are counting on Brügger to live up to his promises of investing and creating jobs in the area. But for all the time Brügger spends darkly sending up this diplomatic culture (what with his leather boots and cigarette holder), it's hard to enjoy yourself watching The Ambassador.

The film, as you might have guessed by this point, is a documentary along the lines of Exit Through the Gift Shop and Catfish. The access Brügger gains into the upper levels of the Central African Republic government is nothing short of astonishing. He films his meetings with them in what must be the only safe style-using either a handheld camera operated by an unknown associate or using hidden cameras rigged to his person or in his apartment. Lord knows what would have happened to Brügger if one of these cameras was discovered.

It's such a ludicrous situation that one can't help but as least question the legitimacy of it all. Were these people in on Brügger's joke the whole time? Certainly not all of them, as we learn late in the film that one interviewee was found dead (though there doesn't seem to be any connection whatsoever to Brügger). But a good portion of The Ambassador's budget must have been spent on paying off these high-ranking government officials-some good, old-fashioned ""Don't kill me, please"" money.

Brügger doesn't flinch when dealing with any of these people-the mark of an outstanding performer. But one wonders how he could emotionally remove himself from these people and this situation so thoroughly. That's the mark of someone with a few screws loose. Whether you view The Ambassador as a brilliant piece of gonzo journalism or a despicable, deceptive mockumentary that manipulates third-world men and women, it's hard to argue against the film's originality. I can guarantee you won't see anything like The Ambassador this year.

"445",445,"I am revisiting this film after seeing it live in theatres in 1983.  On the surface it's but a rebellious teenage flick with little plot  .... but timing is everything, as they say, and the fact that it predates the launch of MTV makes it chronologically important in the history of music. When I saw it back in the 80s, I left the theatre feeling energized by the music ... when I saw it recently I, again, was energized by the infectious soundtrack.  The (although not mentioned) Mormon-Esque subplot as the antagonist to free dance versus being on the cusp of the Video Music Explosion era is an extraordinary clashing of two different worlds and generations. Bacon is convincing in a leading role, and you could tell Sarah Jessica Parker's (limited) presence was going to take her the places that it has. The Rocky Mountain backdrop is a compelling cinematographic bonus that works nicely in contrast to the closer-up people and dance scenes.",5
"446",446,", a 1984 film featuring Kevin Bacon, is a very relevant film. The movie is based on a law that nearly passed in a small Oklahoma town back in the late 1800s. The film follows several characters trying to convince the hard-hearted citizens that dancing and singing are not evil and can bring great joy. This same message, despite being of a more somber and serious matter, can be applied to the situation we face on a national scale. In our time, people cannot even say they are from another political party, have nuanced positions, or pursue interests without getting judged. Throughout the film, we see Ren (Kevin Bacon) fall hard for Ariel (Lori Singer), the daughter of a stereotypical Evangelical preacher who is against singing and dancing. Despite being a preacher's daughter, Ariel is a rebel, who is willing to have fun and be a teen. With her friends, the ban on rock and roll and dancing was lifted.  Movements such as Black Lives Matter, Back the Blue, and others are based on this principle, community and solidarity.",5

I still would've preferred they emphasis different parts of the movie than they ultimately did; it seemed like they didn't do any test audience screenings or adjustments to their screenplay to emphasize the best parts of the movie because if they did there would've been much more Lithgow and, yeah, much more dancing. I don't see how it took a 100-mile trip to a bar to convince the kids that dancing would be nice, and excusing Lithgow's daughter's wildly irresponsible behavior by noting her daddy issues didn't make sense to me as a parent, either. I still didn't hate the movie though, in part because it'd been over 700 movies since I'd last seen Bacon but also because the movie as it is still made for compelling viewing material.",3

Eddie Redmayne plays a young man smitten with the movies whose dream comes true (and how!) when he not only gets to work in film but gets to work side-by-side with one of the lasting icons. Kenneth Branagh, Dame Judy Dench, and Derek Jacoby, among others, who are English film royalty themselves play older English film royalty playing Carpathian royalty visiting Britain in a light inconsequential romantic comedy, who all recognize that Marilyn was something different, something special and apart. And there's the point of this work, not the film that they were working on, or whatever events may or may not have transpired in the process, but rather simply the English appreciation and love of an American star. It's a nice postcard from overseas saying, ""Missing you"" delivered with Brit charm.",4
"459",459,"I don't think they meant to do it, but they actually managed to capture the real essence of a Monroe movie here. Sure, the actual screenplay is bad. Sure, the supporting characters are one-dimensional despite being portrayed well by their actors. Yes, there's a lack of apparent purpose or sense of soul. But that's actually exactly what most of Monroe's movies were like where she was the star: they were designed primarily to put her on a pedestal for the audience to ogle at. While this was ostensibly about Monroe as a person, most of the characters she played on screen were extensions of the persona she created for herself and thus this came off extremely similar to movies like The Seven Year Itch. None of these things seemed intentional; they spent plenty of screentime on Redmayne & Branagh's characters and chose a specific, narrow timeframe so as to tell a story hopefully less known to the general public than the major events of Marilyn's life. Through what appears to be directorial inexperience and an uneven level of talent spread across the cast & crew, the movie ends up carried on the shoulders of both Michelle's portrayal and the costumes she ends up wearing. There's room to wish for a truly perfect Monroe biopic, but what we got instead was an effective homage to her and the movies she made. Hooray!",4
"460",460,"Marilyn Monroe's legacy is defined as seen through symbolic imagery and significant classics, while anything else regarding her true self behind her pictured, invested roles is rarely [documented], accessibly underneath lesser interest for separated generations. Director Simon Curtis offers a slight intimate portrait on actually getting to know Monroe outside her roles with Michelle Williams perfectly casted as the actress, and the result probably honors her legacy by unearthing a truer layer with faithful, spiritual connection; alongside a nice cast, especially Williams sharing a freely expressed chemistry with Redmayne.

I think all of the actors do a great job, but Williams makes this movie her own. The story is decently interesting, but I think Marilyn Monroe deserves an entire movie just about her life, and this definitely isn't that. If her life was told in a miniseries format, the plot of this movie could have covered one episode. I think it is an interesting and sweet movie, but I feel like there are more fascinating aspects of the Hollywood icon's life out there. Nonetheless, it is worth watching because Michelle Williams gives such a tremendous performance and would be my first choice to star as Marilyn Monroe in any other movie made about her in the near future.",4

"467",467,"Martin Scorsese's love letter to cinema.

Director Martin Scorsese's fantasy family adventure-drama  (2011) doubles as a historical drama biopic about influential French director Georges Méliès from the early 1900's. Scorsese's direction is impressive as he both recreates old Paris at the turn of the century and finds this heartfelt warmth and moody darkness to every character's deeper emotions. Scorsese's  is so incredible as you think you're merely watching a sweet family drama, but Scorsese leads you on an inspiring adventure into romance and biopic as he recounts Méliès' entire life story in the second half of .

I return to revisit  every year or so as it has become a comfort film for me. I appreciate Johnny Depp producing  as his respect for where films have come from is clearly as passionate as Scorsese's worship of the theater. Scorsese even cameos as Méliès' photographer towards the end.  is Scorsese's cutest movie by far.  will instill the magic of moviemaking and rekindle a passionate fire and childlike wonder for cinema. 

Screenwriter John Logan lovingly adapts Brian Selznick's novel with an intimate understanding of the loneliness and desperation of orphans, the isolating solitude of lovelessness, the loving embrace of caring adults and nurturing parents, and the intricate complexity of early filmmaking like clockwork. Brian Selznick even cameos as a party guest in the finale epilogue scene.

Child actor Asa Butterfield is incredibly subtle and expressive as orphaned clockworker and young film enthusiast  Cabret. It's a shame his adult career never took off as his acting prowess and realism is ever present with his touching emotional performance as Scorsese's lead hero . Child actress Chloë Grace Moretz delivers a very genuine and fun loving performance as the excitable Isabelle. Her gentle empathy for  and ability to inspire a sense of adventure in him is very cute. She's really adorable in  and it's a real display of her acting range as she had just played Hit-Girl the year before.

I like seeing the late Christopher Lee as the nice book store owner Monsieur Labisse, who gently offers  a chance to read once more as he did with his father, played by the gentle and loving Jude Law. I honestly wish we got more time with Jude Law's earnest and nuanced father figure, but that is the point as  too is deprived of his kind presence. Law demonstrates to  both a mastery of clockwork, knowledge of the real world, and a love of creative films.

 is both hilarious and heartbreaking as  dashes to escape Sacha Baron Cohen's ridiculous train station inspector with his bum leg and vicious hound, who has a very tender if awkward romance drama with the adorable and patient Emily Mortimer as the flower vendor Lisette. Frances de la Tour and Richard Griffiths have this quaint elderly romance in the midst of Huge as Madame Emilie and Monsieur Frick alongside their cuddly dogs. Ray Winstone is excellent as 's drunkard Uncle Claude with his bitter realism and clockwork skills.

Meanwhile, Scorsese captures the most moving performance ever from Sir Ben Kingsley as Georges Méliès himself. Kingsley starts out as jaded and mean to the point of being cruel as Méliès believes he is forgotten as a founder of film. Then, slowly Kingsley shows that Méliès is as broken as one of his antique toys in the train station toy shop he owns in relative poverty. It's wonderful to see Kingsley giving a role wherein he can melt away his rage and pain into this kind old gentleman as he rediscovers the power of movies to move someone to their core. 

Similarly, Helen McCrory is very intriguing and compassionate as Mama Jeanne as she's clearly just being protective of Méliès when she casts out , so that he will not hurt anyone thinking about their tragic past. Michael Stuhlbarg is incredible as the sensitive and eager Film Professor Rene Rabard as he shows everyone the simple majesty of watching an imaginative picture for the first time.

Editor Thelma Schoonmaker cuts effortlessly from past filmmaking sequences to the sharp goings on of Paris. Her sleek edits keep  moving briskly for 126 minutes that does not feel  long at all. Cinematographer Robert Richardson beautifully shoots  with a sterling eye for inventive callbacks to classic pictures as well as finding creative ways to film in this one train station. Dante Ferretti's production design carefully constructs these fun and eerie train station sets of old Paris that look real. Stuart Rose, David Warren, and Martin Foley's art direction is amazing as the city looks stunning and all the clockwork gears really captivate you. Francesca Lo Schiavo's set decoration gives off this warmth feeling for the Parisian homes and the train station is full of neat detail.

Composer Howard Shore's score is both modern in his symphonic style, but also harkens back to early cinema with his delightful music for . I love Sandy Powell's old costumes for  that look like this bygone era down to the early movie outfits. Morag Ross, Kate Benton, and Deborah Jarvis' make-up is classy and striking with new appearances for every actor and actress.

The acting was great, the story was great, sound design was very cool. Amanda, Justin, did great!

What I think WAS a problem was that in the writing itself a lot of things were rushed and feel like we weren't given enough information as to ""why"" things are the way they are.
Why is Salas basically a super-agent? Why is Sylvia so rebellious? How is technology so advanced that we have a ""time-limit"" printed into our genetic code but simultaneously we are so primitive you can steal someone's time all the way to zero (IN THEIR SLEEP NO LESS) simply by flicking your wrist upside down? 
You get dumped in the middle of the story and need to just accept a lot of things the way they are. The actors and cinematography do a great job of carrying the viewers along for the ride, but I find myself wishing the movie had been longer and would have taken more time to ""explain"" certain things. T
Generally, films try to give you enough substance in all the genres this film touched: sci-fi, superagent, armageddon, thrillers, pretty much all movies! We need that ""substance"" to connect more with the characters.

The flashes that this movie gave me of visiting my grandfather in the nursing home were tough to endure. Right from the outset, I want to be upfront with the fact that I had a moderately negative reaction to The , because of how it made me feel. It’s not poorly made, and the fact that I had a negative reaction to certain things is actually a good sign that it was telling an authentic story. However, I rate movies based on my personal enjoyment, and this was not all that enjoyable. This is not the first film that I’ve seen which tackles the realities of caring for aging parents with an understated and naturalistic approach, and I think others have done it better, but The  is still effective. Stylistically, this movie felt like any number of indie films I’ve watched with quirky characters dealing with tough life situations, and at this point they need something special to make the movie stick out in my mind. I imagine I will forget all about The  given enough time. Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman had some nice interactions throughout the film. To my surprise, the movie isn’t really about Philip Bosco as the father. His declining health is just a significant point of stress, and we get to see how that influences the day to day lives of his children. In fact, we don’t see a ton of the father in the film, and often exit his room to see how Linney and Hoffman are handling things. I wish the movie spent a bit more time exploring their father’s checkered past, because I kept looking for some cathartic moment when they dealt with their issues. Instead the movie avoids going deep into the family history, and explores their current-day relationship struggles. The ending made me feel a bit cheated, because we see how they progress forward in their lives, but I never saw the film lay the groundwork that would equal this kind of growth. I acknowledge that The  is an earnest story that explores some complicated issues, but it was tough to watch at times, and didn’t deliver as well as I was hoping at the end.",3
"550",6,"Somber with splashes of laugh-out-loud moments, The  is a solid film about taking care of someone who probably doesn't deserve it. ""Sun City"" looks like it was dropped out of a brochure (think Edward Scissorhands), but we don't stay there long and instead shift to blistery Buffalo. The subtly of the ""cookie"" scene at the support group was the funniest moment. The ""blackface"" scene was cringe-worthy but funny. I had thought it would be a more split story between Jon (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Wendy (Laura Linney), but the focus remains on Wendy as the main protag. Wish more PSH. Could always go for more PSH. Of course, 100/100 for Genghis.",4

Jenkins's immortal lifestyle and mortal characters carries heavy words than a sword ever could. And finding an honest persistent voice in this war where there is no opponent, and yet has an engaging battle to keep us at the brisk of our emotions, it gets to reap its inspiring flag. The pragmatic conversation glides along with smart humorous narration that can be as light as a puff of smoke and heavy as the deepest emotion bubbled up with stunning chemistry among the cast. Where it ponders on about the usual textbook structure and the concept of a typical family drama, the theme it digs upon is a head scratching masterpiece.

One of its major strength, the equation of two siblings; a brother and a sister, is so accurately descriptive that you cannot not communicate with it. From tiny bickering intuitions to mocking each other even at the lowest moment, the bonding of them grows stronger and stronger as they manage to stay together in this big chunk of mess. Linney as the emotionally fueled and also challenged sister, is a treat to watch for her gullible nature with strong will power receives an overwhelming response especially set in this world. Hoffman, on the other hand, is playing more of a supportive role than a parallel one.

With annoyance on the surface in his hot headed mind, he is more of a father to her sister, than her actual father is. Complaining their way in, this absorbing tale evolves into supporting and devouring each other for their mistakes and their capabilities. Addition to that, the signature tone of Jenkins of drawing out humor from the awkward silence and social uneasiness, she lightens the mood through the habitual rituals of the characters rather than some big hysterical incident.

(2012) 
PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMA/ THRILLER

  Written, directed and starred by Martin Donovan centering on a situation, he plays screenplay writer Robert Longfellow who upon coming home to visit his mother for reasons unclear.  But for the first 30 or 40 minutes into the film Robert revaluate old times including a publicized widowed actress who he still has feelings for.  And then his neighbor Gus (David Morse) who lives across the street from him takes him hostage.

 I liked the bonding scenes when Robert converses with Gus about how to become a successful screenwriter, but the ending is a real downer which the center character leaves viewers somewhat wanting to know more.

2 out of 4 stars",2

"563",19,"Hm, this movie follows a path the viewer is not expecting, at least I didn't. It wasn't a good choice in my opinion, because in essence, the initial path until that moment, the first half of the movie, was an entertaining and interesting one. The character built-up was short, but effective, and the acting from both main character Robert (Martin Donovan) and loser Gus (David Morse) was very good. The mentioned choice for a no-win stand-off with the police instead of an interesting fling and movie idea with a hollywood hottie was a poor one. Sure, it had it's positive moments as well. For instance, it was at least a concious choice which the movie put all their effort in, leading to good and thought- provoking acting scenes. However, the police stand-off choice predominantly had a negative effect on the films quality. For instance, the many phonecalls that interrupted the whole thing and thereby the lacking the physical contact between those calling characters made it all feel a little fake and made-up. The worst thing: we didn't get to see what kind of relationship Robert had with his old flame or what his family meant to him. Nothing of that anymore, just a hurt wife and worried ex. Having said all that, I really need to say this movie was entertaining and good, just not an exceptional one.",4

"565",21,"Nancy Savoca's film never quite allows it's audience to decide if it is OK to laugh or if we should feel ashamed. This thin line between dark comedy and dark drama is the gateway to Savoca's point. The film seems a bit slight, but it lingers with you. This is the kind of filmmaking it would be nice to see more of -- a realistic story about human damage that is brave enough to present these life challenges as something we must learn to deal with, live through and make the most of it. In a strange way, this movie approaches cinematic ""truth"" in a realism that actually makes sense. Mira Sorvino is the film's center. She is so incredibly true and realistic in her performance -- it would almost be easier for the viewer if she had pushed her realism just a little over-the-top. Lucky for us, Sorvino isn't that kind of actor. She is quietly brilliant and like her director, she's not going to offer an easy way out of the complications of family life. The film comes very close to being just shy of amazing.",4

Really sad, occasionally disturbing, but awesome directing and screenwriting.",4
"574",30,"The film was so so. It reminded me of two films, Pieces of April and In Her Shoes. Those films were better than this one. The film had the same look and style that Pieces of April did. Mira Sorvino's character reminded me of Cameron Diaz's character in, In Her Shoes. While, Tammy Blanchard's character reminded me of Toni Collete's character in, In Her Shoes. I was surprised by the short running time of this movie. The pacing is also a little off. At times, the film feels like a stage play.

The best part of the film are the performances. Mira Sorvino does a great job here. I would love to see her in more roles. Tammy Blanchard is good here too. Both her and Sorvino have a great on screen chemistry as sisters. Michael Rispoli and Patti LuPone are good in their supporting roles.

"577",33,"Shut Up and Play the Hits is a ""rockumentary"" of the hit alternative dance band known as LCD Soundsystem. The film follows the before, during, and after of the band's final performance at Madison Square Gardens and how frontman James Murphy contemplates his decisions. To start off, you don't have to be a fan of this band to enjoy or follow this movie. It'll probably be more fun to watch if you do know the band however, and I thoroughly enjoyed Shut Up and Play the Hits. I'm a big fan of LCD Soundsystem, but I'm not going gaga over it simply because I like the band, it's just a really good rockumentary. The timeline of events and how Murphy reacts through it all is beautifully directed, as well as the concert scenes. You wonder at the very beginning why are they quitting the band after so much success but then as the story progresses, you start to understand why and then he gained my full respect. He wants to quit so he can live a normal life and start a family while also making an impact on the ever growing music industry. He didn't want to overstay his welcome or create a record no one liked, he just wanted to feel significant but felt insignificant the entire film. There's some heartbreaking scenes in the film that feel real. When Murphy starts tearing up in the old studio, I sympathized with him because it's hard to say goodbye to people you've gotten to know very well over the past years and the career you had. The interview throughout the entire runtime was flawless and thought provoking. The interviewer asked questions that really made you think as well as James Murphy's responses. That's how you feel convinced in the end, is through the interview which was one of the best factors of the film. My only complaint is that I would've like more concert time because there was a ton more footage that wasn't shown. I would've loved this even more if it was a concert film with the interview. Shut Up and Play the Hits is a fantastic documentary and analyzation of LCD Soundsystem through their tough times they went through on their last tour. It's an emotional ride with a really likable band and lead character. A-",5

The plot of this film is not as original as the idea it was spawned from or the effects used to present it.",3
"607",63,"""In 1945, Nazis went to the moon. In 2018, they're coming back."" It's a tagline that was certainly enough to sell me, and I've been meaning to watch this for some time. The tagline is very much the set up, and the film opens with some very impressive special effects, showing us the surviving Nazi's set up on the dark side of the moon. The effects in general are splendid, especially for what essentially is a 1970's style Naziploitation film, perhaps not quite in the sexual style of something like Ilsa, She Wolf Of The SS (1975) but certainly in a more modern style of B-movie. Having said that, it is the third most expensive Finnish film ever made, so to call it a B-movie feels a tad harsh. It was a pleasure to see Gotz Otto on the screen again, I'm not convinced I've seen him in a film since he played mad henchman Stamper in the 1997 Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies. He plays Klaus Adler, who travels to Earth with female Reich member Renate to prepare the imminent Nazi re-invasion. And he's terrific in the role, as is Julia Dietze as Renate. Both throw everything at the ludicrous tongue in cheek material, and are both forced to question their long standing beliefs once the Moon Nazi UFO armada lands on earth, and Moon Fuhrer Udo Kier turns up to chew the scenery and reek havoc. An yes, you did read that sentence correctly. Iron Sky is a blast, it's an old fashioned Naziploitation movie that cares about its own output and as a result provides excellent entertainment from start to finnish (pun intended).",3
"608",64,"""Iron Sky"" is a decently enjoyable flick that defies logic - Nazi living on the dark side of the Moon! - yet manages to pull it off with tongue in cheek humor, ok dialogue and a plot that can use some work but delivers. Gotz Otto, the wannabe Fuhrer, is the standout performance, playing off well against mega c u next tuesday Peta Sergeant, while the other two leads, Dietze and Kirby, are merely ok. Udo Kier is underutilized while the rest of the actors are middling. Best parts - the sets and weaponry of the Nazi moon base are just spectacular! If you're a fan of the likes of The Simpsons and South Park, ""Iron Sky"" will be for you.",4

"617",73,"Ruby Sparks is a cleverly written romantic-comedy satire. The performances are charming and strong in this surreal story about feminine cliches in the creative space as well as the desertion of such tropes in the face of male arrogance and the fantastical depiction of women in literature and media.",4
"618",74,"Almost a good movie. It's a nice Pygmalion-type idea, the screwed up, unsocial guy unwittingly creates a women from his imagination and she's perfect, except that he is not, and relationships are not, and he ruins it. They had to tag on a ridiculous happy ending so that they could call it a Rom-Com but one can't help but think, he's the same screwed up guy so it's going to be the same failed relationship. This could have been a really good dark movie -  the movies like to say that happiness is within you -- this one could have told the story that no matter how perfect things seem, unhappiness is within you if you're a jerk. Our ""hero"" in this film will find a way to be unhappy no matter what.",3
"619",75,"Definitely more of a fascinating thought experiment than it is a satisfying romantic comedy, ""Ruby Sparks"" finds Zoe Kazan at her most metaphysically flexible, filling both the role of screenwriter and titular performer in a movie about an author whose creation literally blinks off the page and into corporeality. Add in the fact that Kazan's real life partner, Paul Dano, occupies the role of the aforementioned writer and you've got yourself the potential for a real mind-bender. In reality, though, ""Ruby Sparks"" ends up playing things rather safely, focusing heavily on the ethical dilemma at hand and how the protagonist's neuroses revolve around, effect and even change in relation to it. This approach is ultimately to the film's benefit, with Dano and Kazan's performances really anchoring the drama and philosophical urgency running throughout the narrative. Not a bad experience by any stretch.",4
"620",76,"Love the way this film explores real human relationships through such a surreal concept, and somehow makes it work.",5
"621",77,"Without beating around the bush, I’ll just say that I loved everything about Ruby Sparks. This film is divine from start to finish, and it was one of those movies I didn’t want to end. I was dangerously close to just watching it again immediately after I finished, because I wanted to go through that experience again, and I will be adding it to my film collection as soon as possible. However, there’s some special things going on in this story, and I’d rather not spoil them for anyone who hasn’t seen the film. While I won’t be ruining any specific plot points (just the general premise) I think the magic of the film works better the less you know. So, let me encourage you to see Ruby Sparks before you read any further in my review. Suffice it to say, I think it’s a movie that everyone should see. It’s a new favorite for me. Now that I have that out of the way, I can talk about why this movie clicked for me so much. I appreciated that the film spoke to the insanity of what was happening, when Ruby walks into the real world, but then adjusted as it went on and we were allowed to accept this as the reality of the film. Paul Dano plays it brilliantly, so we experience it all vicariously through him. That way, as soon as he begins to accept that his character is a living person, we can as well. The movie runs the gamut of emotions, just like a real relationship. We experience the highs in almost a romantic comedy tone, and then we experience the lows that become a heavy romantic drama. It’s all built on the premise of a fictional character coming to life, and yet it feels like one of the most non-fictional relationships I’ve ever seen in film. You know a movie is going to be one of your favorites when it transcends simple story-telling and begins to make you think about your life, the choices you’ve made, and the realities of human relationships. Ruby Sparks was connecting so many dots for me that I couldn’t even keep up with it all. The way it shows the complexity of human emotion, and what makes a person authentic was astounding. I was so invested in the story that I spoke to the screen a couple of times without thinking about it, desperate to stop Paul Dano’s character from making a mistake, yet realizing he needed to make that mistake in order to discover what makes Ruby special. I could go on for a long time, but I think I’ll just wrap up by saying it is a crime that Zoe Kazan did not receive more awards recognition for her work on this film. Not only did she write it, but there is some serious complexity to this acting performance, and she nailed it. This movie is a 5-star winner.",5
"622",78,"a very unique romance movie, with a very great performance by Zoe Kazan",5
"623",79,"Love the idea of the authors work coming to life, this film is just missing a little something, interesting plot but had greater potential.",4
"624",80,"Watch this if: You're into comedies that are super clever and more than fluff.

Ruby Sparks is one of the best movies no one's ever heard of. Calvin is a novelist who creates his dream girl Ruby in his latest book. And then, the unexpected happens. This one is so, so original.  It's also brilliant and playful and quirky and romantic and kinda dark at times.",5
"625",81,"The dance artistry is captivating and entertaining.  The whole movie is about various dancing motifs and works.",4
"626",82,"I actually liked this movie a lot. The dance scene in the art museum was incredibly gorgeous and thoughtful.  Yes, Ryan Guzman literally has 0 back story about why he lives with his sister, what she does, why he works at the hotel instead of doing anything else. Peter Gallagher, who I first saw in American Beauty wasn't given enough lines to play the dynamic character he was hinted at being and it was a silhouette of a real person like most of the characters in it. Super bad acting, Kathryn McCormick is barely convincing of demonstrating any real emotion - the Winwood Dance Academy owner lady says some really cheesy cringy lines. And the conclusion is very unrealistic or believable. Big developers with millions invested don't just give up on a deal due to sentiment..and why is no one pointing out that being a billboard for Nike is a rather disappointing conclusion for a dance group who started to get momentum finally after aligning with a social cause and meaningful movement? And..yet...I still really liked it. There were some incredible dance moments there, reminding me of old school Stomp films and the fact that 
Guzman had no prior dance experience yet was able to train to dance this well for the movie? Like...damn...that is pretty impressive.",3
"627",83,"I think too many don´t understand what the movie´s main essence, what it´s point is. What matters firstly is the art within the different scenes, within the ""flashmobs"" ; The synergy between different and new locations, outfits, choreography and the effort put in here. All this makes the film feel fresh, finally something new. The conflict given i find to be not too far-fetched, people might be able to connect with it all over the world, kew-word: Theft and destruction of habitat to economize on.",5
"628",84,"I honestly love it. I watched it as a kid all the time and now I decided to watch it again then it brought back so many memories. It just a good movie I love the plot and the setting around it all.",5
"629",85,"Honestly, I could just copy and paste my review from Step Up 5, since my opinion is the same, especially since both of them star the same actor, rather than the disconnected nature of the last three movies. Basically, the acting's okay and the dance choreography is a lot of fun but the story keeps obstructing the path to greatness. Well, as great as a series of barely connected movies about dancing can get. But the awesome dance sequences prevent me from hating this movie. So, there's that. Also, nice to know that Miami Heat actually was the alternative title in the UK and not just something that my mind made up after seeing it advertised in France as ""Sexy Dance 4: Miami Heat"".",3
"630",86,"It is becoming very mediocre at this point with the movies consistently having great dances, a love story between two head dancers, and a thin/weak plot and story. To be honest though, I still watch these for nostalgia",4

"635",91,"It was playing like a typical anti-hero type of movie for much of it's runtime with a somewhat dark comedy feel to it because' what else could it be?'  As a result, I felt there were a limited number of ways for it to go to make it something more and that was the big mystery throughout.  Barely, but I think it did go the direction it needed to in order to make it something more... though it still felt like a dark comedy in the end.",4

"641",97,"Recommend Killer Joe or not is a difficult job. It's much, MUCH better than Bug, the characters here are interesting and the actors are involved, especially Juno Temple, Matthew McConaughey and Emile Hirsch. The movie is well directed, it has a good rhythm and cool action sequences. Tracy Letts' dialogues are the problem here. Some of them are artificial. He's definetly not in Quentin Tarantino's level, like the director William Friedkin. And I really don't know why, but sex and nudity always bother me, and the chicken scene is probably worst than every sex apology that I saw in my life. At least the ending, by the way, the last event, is PERFECT!",4

"646",102,"Really a well conceived and constructed film in terms of travel, range of interview subjects, archival footage and so on.

Searching for Sugar Man also presents some unusual paradoxes about music marketing; under the repressive police state (and extreme racism) of the Sth African regime, the Detroit protest singer became a beacon (or symbol) of hope and social change for liberal Sth Africa, selling widely among an audience despite some street-drug references that led to an airplay ban (the track is clearly about the pathos and hardship of lives turned to drug abuse, not any kind of glowing recommendation). . . also the rose-tinted view of the cult rock artist sort of clashes with the reality of Sth Africa's persisting problems; it's still a violent, impoverished state without significant assets ceded to it's formerly oppressed black population. What you learn is that Sth Africa's isolation contributed to his star status there, not the progress of Sth Africans.

Rodriguez's lack of commercial success despite an appealing voice, great lyrics, professional production is still never fully answered. Like Big Star's album of 1972, some say the record was ultimately a failure due to a half-explained lack of marketing presence, which perhaps tellingly explains that the radio mainstays you hear across the English speaking world are actually backed up by significant marketing expenditure. Searching for Sugarman hints at but never fully explains why his two cult albums disappeared from circulation. 

Admittedly, MANY talented musicians cut recordings throughout the 1960s and 70s and were largely unheard of, so there's that consideration, although A&M, now owned by Universal are exactly the type of ""gatekeepers"" that used their commercial influence for musical exposure.",4

"650",106,"Well-structured and entertaining, Searching for Sugar Man takes a look at one of the strangest events in 20th century music - a star who is unaware of his fame, and his fans who know nothing about him. A story of passion and acceptance that is as heartwarming as it is unlikely, this documentary will surely satisfy even those who have no prior familiarity with the subject. If there is a criticism, it is the lack of pressure on documenting the circumstances that prevented Rodriguez's recognition; the filmmaker identified parties involved, but failed to follow up on the paper trail that he established as to where royalties from the South African music sales actually ended up. Give us the juicy details, man! (4/5)",4
"651",107,"Searching for Sugar Man is the remarkable documentary about Sixto Rodriguez, a singer and guitarist from Detroit, slated to be the next Dylan, who released two albums in the early 1970s.  The albums were critical successes but commercial failures, resulting in Rodriguez fading from public view.  While the film is about what happened to Rodriguez, it also touches on politics, music, race, destiny, dreams fulfilled and denied, perceptions of success and failure, definitions of wealth, and a host of other subjects.  What happens over the course of the film is stunning and inspiring and, as one journalist points out, ""against the laws of God and nature.""  A word of warning to anyone about to watch Searching for Sugar Man: don't do any research in advance.  Just let the movie wash over you and enjoy.",5

This is Paul Verhoeven bringing his fun satire and over-the-top violence to play ball with an arguably miscast yet undeniably charming Arnold Schwarzeneggar. The end result is just pure entertainment bliss, with the added benefit of being a fairly smart narrative.",5

La trama es muy buena y original, con una historia entretenida y con muchos giros a todo momento que te enganchan mas y para que al final quedes sorprendido. Los efectos especiales de la película, a pesar de haberse hecho hace poco mas de 30 años, me parecen muy buenos. La acción de la película es genial, muy bien hecha e implementada. Por otro lado, todos los escenarios que crearon para las escenas son geniales y están muy bien hechos. Las actuaciones están bien y además siempre es muy bueno ver a Arnold Schwarzenegger en un papel. Por otro lado, toda la parte final de la película se me hizo larga y tediosa, aunque después el final me gusto. En conclusión, yo creo que es una película muy buena, que es una vista obligada para los fanáticos de la ciencia ficción.",4

I didn't mind some of the action scenes which were pretty cool and decent plus some good one-liners, but the plot and certain events that took place were so ridiculous that I couldn't help but want the movie to end. It was also too unnecessarily sexualized and some of the special effects don't hold up unlike other movies that came out around that time.",2
"660",116,"Great concept (based on the short story) The ending got ridiculous. Seems to influence other movies like The Matrix, Truman Show and Inception.",4
"661",117,"Arnold movies in our household were not defined by its 'rating' but rather by the creativity of the deaths and the quality of the one-liners that followed. My dad would randomly blurt out 'Arnie' one liners while wandering around the house. 'What happened to Buzzsaw??' ...'He had to split.' 'Let off some steam, Bennett.' It was a glorious childhood. BUT Total Recall BLEW MY F*KING MIND. I still think to this day it would be one of the movies I would want with me if I ever found myself stranded on a desert island. I had previously watched Verhoeven's Robocop, ANOTHER movie that my parents got into an argument over whether or not I should be able to watch it. Somehow common sense gave way and my dad won the argument with the it's SO violent that it would come across not disturbing... but comical. Thanks dad. The melting henchman splattered by a ford taurus still haunts me to this day. BUT I remember watching Total Recall and it was like a new kind of movie I had never seen before. Science fiction, action, mystery, comedy... It rendered my 10 year old brain into useless grey mush. It had Arnie splatting and crunching guys left and right but ON MARS. The makeup and effects... are still amazing. Even with the '2 weeks' woman's disguise sectioning off and revealing an obviously practical Arnie head (which there's gotta be a good amount used in this movie) with a giant metal bracket behind for what reason?? Who cares... I still LOVE. And Kuato... or 'SEE YOU AT THE PARTY RICHTER!' Not to mention one of the best villain deaths of all time. God, I just love this movie. I'm actually gonna wrap this up and go watch it... see ya.",5
"662",118,"Paul Verhoeven directed one of my all-time favorites in Starship Troopers and created a sci-fi psychological thriller seven-years earlier with Total Recall. There's enough indulgent violence and sex for the teenagers (a woman in a futuristic Mars bordello flashes her thrice-breasted chest), and enough existential questions for the adults. That's not to say there aren't visual delights for the rest of us, for Total Recall has a secret weapon — Rob-f****n'-Bottin (The Thing), the master of practical effects. If you're a long-time reader of my blog, you'll know I gush for practical effects, and Bottin gets to flex his muscles with the eye-popping, head-deformed, mini-humanoid-bulging-out-of-his-brother's-body moments. As an adaptation of a Philip K. Dick short-story (We Can Remember It For You Wholesale), the movie includes many of the signature futuristic, sci-fi elements that have become staples of the genre: self-driving cars/cabs, omnipresent screens, body scanners for weapons/contraband, holograms, space colonies, etc. But what is centrally featured in Total Recall is the timeless concept of memories and dreams. Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is just your average construction worker (bet your ass we get a shot of his sleeveless arms working a jackhammer) with dreams of travel… or he's a secret agent… or he's the memory of a secret-agent inside the mind of an average construction worker? Quaid travels to Mars (or he doesn't) to answer the question of who he really is, or he pays the Rekall company to have these action-packed, sex-filled memories implanted in his brain — the 2089 equivalent of a ""staycation"". *Side Note* I love how Arnie's accent, in any movie, is never questioned, sort of an unwritten rule. Sure, the film has typical stupid action movie moments — when he arrives at Mars comes to mind — but I suppose it's part of that Verhoeven schlock. The ""red light"" district on Mars is one of the coolest sets I've seen and the film has a bunch of the same actors we later see in Starship Troopers: Michael Ironside, Marshall Bell, and Dean Norris. Pretty standard message of ""whoever controls the resources (here, air) controls society"". Total Recall is a must-watch for sci-fi fans. So long as you don't mind a badass dwarf (Debbie Lee Carrington) shooting a machine-gun, three-breasted prostitutes, eyes being sucked out of heads and other gratuitous violence, you will also enjoy this film.",5

"664",120,"As you know, I've banged on about my love for Paul Verhoeven repeatedly, but I realised at the weekend I was a fraudulent fan; I'd never seen Total Recall. How I'd managed this is beyond me, but I have now thankfully have rectified this shortcoming, and, of course, Total Recall is brilliant. Verhoeven's eye for depicting futuristic dystopias is masterful, most notably in Robocop (1987). Totall Recall is loosely based on a Philip K Dick short, much like Blade Runner several years earlier, and although Total Recall is no match for that in terms of masterpieces of sci-fi, it doesn't aim to be. There's some wonderful world building both in the scenes on Earth and on Mars, as a fantastic Arnold Schwarzenegger runs riot trying to work out whether is mind has been stolen from him, whether it's all a dream, or indeed whether he actually exists or not. It really is a blast, but Verhoeven's attention to detail (especially in a seedy bar area of the Mars colony) puts you front and centre of the mayhem, and goes to pains to ensure the effects are impressive, and they even hold up well today. It's a shame I have to once again point out not to bother with the 2012 remake, but even more shameful on my part is that I saw the 2012 version first. My only defence is that I have at least now, tried to right my wrongs as best I can in that respect.",4

Perhaps more disturbing is when I think there are politicians who could win elections with these exact practices, even if they are ridiculous. I didn’t find any of it funny as they revel in the most juvenile sexual humor imaginable. There also isn’t much plot to talk about in The Campaign. It’s literally just the story of an ugly smear campaign between two infantile candidates who will do anything to get elected. The issues don’t matter, the characters don’t matter, it’s a framework for bad jokes and lazy improv. I was so disgusted and annoyed that I couldn’t care less how it ended. The whole movie is a great example of the sorry state of modern comedy. You don’t have to write anything clever nowadays. Instead you just create a situation, add some extreme sexual comedy and a whole lot of profanity, then sprinkle in a bunch of goofy unrealistic characters that feel like they were hatched in an SNL writers’ room, finally leave room for a good amount of improvisation.

"713",169,"Actress Julie Delpy shot to art-house stardom after playing Celine in Richard Linklater's sublime Euro-romance Before Sunrise. She reprised the role in the director's somewhat unexpected follow-up, Before Sunset, almost a decade later.

Since then, Delpy has been largely absent from the big screen minus one big exception-a 2007 film 2 Days in Paris, which Delpy starred in, wrote, and directed. The film drummed up little money, but its tone was quite unique. Its blend of Before Sunrise's emotional earnestness and Woody Allen-esque broad comedy was a breath of fresh air five years ago. And like Linklater did with his 1995 film, she clearly thought there was still oil in these fields. Unfortunately, 2 Days in New York proves the well was bone-dry.

The film, like 2 Days in Paris, follows Delpy's Marion Dupres, but a lot has changed in her life since we last saw her. Using puppets (the first clue of what's to come), Marion tells us she and her boyfriend of the first film, Adam Goldberg's Jack, had a child together but split up shortly afterward. He's still in her life, but her new partner is Mingus (Chris Rock), a popular New York-based talk radio host with a child of his own from a previous marriage. Also, Marion's mother has passed away, leaving her father (Delpy's real-life father, Albert) completely shaken.

Marion, an inexplicably successful photographer despite her obvious lack of talent (other characters' words), decides to fly Papa Dupres to New York for a visit. Sister Rose (Alexia Landeau) also makes the trip, as does her boyfriend (and Marion's ex), Manu (Alex Nahon). It's a regular motley crue, and their constant bickering and appaling behavior threaten to disrupt Mingus and Marion's carefully crafted life together.

Though Delpy's two films follow similar narrative paths, the contributing factors to the central conflicts are quite different. In 2 Days in Paris, Marion and Jack are at a crossroads even before they embark on a ""romantic"" tour of Europe. Their troubles quickly become exacerbated by their cultural differences and Marion's overbearing family. In 2 Days in New York, Marion and Mingus are quite compatible and have no obvious cracks in their relationship. The conflict, then, must be derived solely from Marion's visiting relatives, who, in the years since we last saw them, must have been abducted by aliens and injected with something that's made them insane. The behavior of her father, sister, and Manu is so absurd and over-written that the resulting conflict feels contrived and superficial.

That might be forgivable if the comedy was side-splittingly funny, but jokes are hit-and-miss. Some of 2 Days in New York is funny, including just about everything Chris Rock (who's playing a very low-key version of his usual character) does. A lot of it, though, is either crazy over-the-top (like Marion's father wearing a feather on his head) or goes nowhere (like Marion's father keying a limousine) .

Delpy's Marion wasn't the sweetest, most likable heroine the first time we saw her, but she was nowhere near as harpy then as she is now. The film's final act tries to clumsily explain that, but it's a reveal you see coming a mile away thanks to a screenplay that's about as subtle as a blunt axe. She's always shouting at someone (usually Rose) and is so indescribably selfish that it's almost impossible to believe she's a real person.

Ditto Manu, who walks into Mingus' life wearing a T-shirt that says ""Obama Homeboy"". He's brazenly racist and not at all afraid to overstep his boundaries, whether it be crashing this family reunion or inviting a drug dealer into Mingus and Marion's apartment. In fact, no one in this film comes across as an authentic character with any real depth outside of Mingus. Rock's performance is easily the best thing about 2 Days in New York. The second-best and maybe the only other worthwhile thing? A pretty hilarious Vincent Gallo cameo.

The film ends with real closure, which hopefully means this is the end for Marion Dupres' big-screen adventures. If it's not, I certainly won't be watching. Delpy has talent, so I really don't know what she was thinking here, but 2 Days in New York is a train wreck and pretty damn close to unwatchable.

'The Odd Life of Timothy Green' is a well intentioned - if, indeed, odd - 2012 film from Disney. CJ Adams gives a respectable and sweet performance as Timothy, while Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton bring the heart in their roles as Cindy and James. The other characters are absolutely terrible, I will say that - especially Rosemarie DeWitt's Brenda.

The film would have been entertaining if there was something more like action. There is overdose of romantic and dramatic scenes which draws us towards tedium. The songs are good, but Due to their poor placement ,they do not look entertaining at all. Performances have been the worst on the part of each and every actor.

"730",186,"Ek Tha Tiger is an Indian action spy film starring Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif in the two main roles. It's marketed on the posters and images of the movie as if it's some kind of full throttle action movie but in truth although containing some fighting and shootouts, it's mostly a weird kind of Rom-Com movie. Of course Bollywood rarely lacks romance and this is the same, it does try to thrill and the ending does add a little boost to the story but it's the beginning that truly drags this down and stops it from being near okay. The choreography is nicely done when it is shown and the dancing and singing is lacking in true style but is still pretty nicely taken care of. The main problem is with the story itself and the over dramatic or just plain stupid scenes that really make this not worthwhile. 

Listen Salman Khan isn't half bad in this but he never truly gets into the role, the action scenes he more than takes care of and he excels mostly at the end, I just don't think he is overly great here in serious dialogue. Katrina Kaif is well cast as Zoya, a lady who reveals her back story the more the story goes on but really she is no different here to a lot of similar leading ladies roles seen elsewhere in Bollywood and fails to make an impact. The cast is kind of well used but never truly that great, it is better when the film focuses more on Salman Khan's character Tiger as the rest of the cast feel a little pointless and the goons placed around the movie are pretty dispensable.

Kabir Khan the director and co-writer had never really made an action movie before doing this so it can't be expected for him to get it spot on; he does however keep it at least fast paced although it can be a little implausible at times. The story is a little stupid in truth and the beginning is not handled well in the script but also in the direction and even in the background music, it can feel as if this is two films split into two and then wrongly put together. The choreography of the dancing as mentioned can be nice but can also be too random, I have always felt that in Bollywood movies the singing and dancing has to be positioned just right for it to work within the plot, this I feel does not time it all right.

So really overall a pretty lame movie but one that can the slightest bit enjoyed if you ignore the silly parts of it. It also has some really nice locations and it isn't filmed that badly, hey even the effects used aren't used overly that much and you don't notice them too much so it's not annoying in that way. Salman Khan can probably take some positives from this as maybe can Kaif but truly this could have been done better, but to be fair I just think the whole story just never worked.",2

It's pretty funny sometimes, even with the potty humor sprinkled in for littler kids it's a pretty intelligent, fun movie. The characters are in a weird place where they both have some depth put into them and are interesting while also most being their own stereotypes, which I don't really mind since it adds to some of the humor. I'm not sure how they achieve this, but despite being caricatures, each of the main characters are also pretty 3D and have some sweet moments, which is nice for a kids' movie. In general I think this is pretty much the perfect movie for a 10-year-old or so, because it caters to little kids enough to make them laugh and enjoy it, while also being a good introduction to mild horror (without scarring kids), and having some nice messages. Those messages are actually what surprised me the most when I rewatched the film, they are very mature and real themes about how fear and lack of understanding can lead to violence and hardship, how bullying is the result of ignorance, and how the dead are always with us in some form. All of these themes, I think, are very necessary for kids to understand while they grow up, and I'm glad that I saw this movie when I was young (thanks Mom!). Also, the animation and acting are both obviously stellar, it's all very fluid and beautiful looking while still being gnarly and gross when it's supposed to be, and all the voices match the characters exactly. Even though its a kids movie that has no right to be this good, it had me legitimately tearing up at the end due to just its sweetness and the amazing images on the screen.

The detailed and expressive characters have so much personality. Sure, everyone is a walking cliche, but they really work as effective storytelling pieces.  has a lot in common with Monster House (2006) and Frankenweenie (2012), so if you ever liked those animated features, I'd say  if the encounter with the dead you're seeking for, but never knew you needed!

Editor Christopher Murrie cuts sharply from scene to scene, so you're never bored.  moves quickly for 90 minutes at a brisk pace with a silly tone that does get dark, but kids, teenagers, and their parents will adore  if they give it a chance. It's a shame  is mostly forgotten as it's quite funny with Chris Butler's heartfelt script that shames witch burners and worships horror movies.  wants to have viewers stand up to their bullies, while understanding those that are different from the norm. Tristan Oliver's cinematography uses these cute wide shots for spooky outdoors sequences and clever visual gags throughout .

Nelson Lowry's quaint production design makes Massachusetts look haunting with that Autumn appeal. Ross Stewart's art direction has whimsical designs with a genuinely creepy look for the spells, zombies, and the fearsome witch. I really appreciate whoever's idea it was that  redeems the concept of witches as really just loner Goth girls who are simply misunderstood. It's very sweet, especially the touching finale. I was surprised at how much I loved . Visual effects artists Brad Schiff, Oliver Jones, Susanna Luck, and Peg Serena really outdid themselves with the cool green spells and will-o-wisp looking spirits. The dynamic witch faces are outstanding for the finale.

Jon Brion's score is so beautifully composed. Brion's music swells throughout  into a tender and haunting serenity that pleasantly surrounds Norman and his friends. Kodi Smit-McPhee is charming and likable as Norman. Jodelle Ferland is phenomenal as Aggie Prenderghast the young witch. She sounds so hurt and natural that I was actually quite moved by her voice acting. Tucker Albrizzi is charming as young fat Neil, Norman's first friend and awkward cowardly companion.

Anna Kendrick's young, selfish Courtney is hilarious as the social media and muscular boy obsessed sister to Norman. Casey Affleck's buff and idiotic Mitch is a riot to watch. Leslie Mann, Jeff Garlin, and John Goodman are excellent as the curious adults all about themselves. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is funny as the bully Alvin. Bernard Hill is amazing as The Judge.

In the end,  doesn't reinvent the Halloween animated movie wheel, but it is nearly as great as Coraline or Frankenweenie.",5

"754",210,"If you know the kinda effort that is put into making a stop-motion animation movie, you'll know what sorta brilliance it would've taken to make a movie like this. Each character and their expressions are handcrafted to perfection and it takes a ridiculously insane amount of patience to stage the characters and shoot them. 

Laika studios have been victorious when it comes to stop-motion and if you still haven't watched their 2016 movie, Kubo and the Two Strings, I urge you all to watch it now. Coming to , the movie is pretty much very simple. I would even admit that this movie is primarily for a younger audience. But the technicalities of it must be devoured by the mature audience as well. No wonder why this film was nominated for an Oscar. 

The comedies worked out pretty well and the character detailing was just phenomenal. Just imagine, they have to 3D print each and every single facial expression and stage it on the board and snap a picture and then make them into a motion picture. Just thinking about it makes me tired. That's why I want you all to witness this technical wonder and praise the art of movie making in its painstaking form.

"776",232,"It was pretty terrible, if I'm being honest. It had an interesting premise about a girl whose life starts going crazy after she supposedly hits a guy with her car, but it consistently doesn't make any sense at times. In the sequence where she accidentally drives off the road at the beginning, you can clearly see that there isn't a person anywhere for her to hit with her car, but somehow the guy ends up being stuck underneath the car anyway when she gets home. And then when she finds him, I was feeling bad for her because it was a legitimate accident that it happened, but the guy grabs her and she decides to bludgeon him to death with a golf club. Any sympathy that I had for her went out the window with that. She took the guys body, wrapped it in a blanket, and buried him somewhere. Then, the movie starts doing this thing where it tries to make it seem like she's just losing her mind. Like I said before, she clearly didn't hit anyone with her car in what they showed at the beginning of the movie, so it looked like he just randomly showed up in her garage. There wasn't a lot of blood underneath the car, even though the guy was pretty effed up from being hit and had been underneath her car for hours. A lightbulb blew out in her garage when she got home, so she removed it and I guess she blacked out and didn't remember replacing it. So when she and her boyfriend go to get the blanket from the guys body and she finds her boyfriend dead and buried where she had buried the guy she supposedly hit with her car, I was like ""Oh, so she's actually imagining the whole thing. Either that, or the guy came back to life as the boyfriend showed up, killed him, wrapped him in the blanket, and buried him all after being run over by a car and bludgeoned by a golf club."" And it turned out that the latter was actually true. And not only that, but he knew exactly who ran him over and managed to perfectly locate her house afterwards, too?

"802",258,"Premium Rush is a fairly straightforward movie about a bicycle messenger in New York City who has to deliver a letter while on the run from some others who want it. The movie is told in a non-linear fashion, often filling in the gaps from the past after the story is established. I found almost the entire movie to be thrilling because they never let things slow down, and the stakes are high. There are a lot of little subplots that are addressed along the way, and I never had a hard time following what was going on. I enjoyed the stylized way they illustrated the decision-making process that these messengers have to make in a matter of seconds. It all worked to put you in the mind of the hero. I also appreciated that they addressed the competitive nature of the job, and how it takes a certain personality to enjoy this kind of work. There were still some cheesy elements to the characters, particularly the “no brakes” stuff, but it didn’t hurt the film for me. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is perfect in the lead role. He has a light-hearted and carefree nature, but also is convincing when he starts to get annoyed and takes things seriously. The true joy of Premium Rush, however, is the delightfully unhinged performance from Michael Shannon. His impatience and mounting frustration are great, and he does it all with a solid New York accent that plays against his usual type. The plot does spin its wheels at times, because the people are literally going in circles. I never lost interest in the story, though. There is a driving momentum to everything that happens, because you can always sense the ticking clock counting down to the delivery deadline. I had a big problem with the final climactic moment, though. That felt horribly out-of-place with the rest of the story, and out-of-character for many of the people we’d met up to that point. I was chuckling at the absurdity of it, and trying not to let it affect my opinion of the film as a whole. I still enjoyed Premium Rush, but it could have been a bit better.",4

What a story, what a corrupt world. How did Brugger get out alive? This is an amazing look into a society and way of life you could not imagine much less make up. There are some really slimy people in the world and this film finds them under every rock.",4
"816",272,"As a film, The Ambassador is fascinating. Danish provocateur/journalist Mads Brügger embeds himself in the dangerous and twisted world of the African business diplomat. With sketchy, black market credentials, the character he's playing moves from Monrovia, Liberia to Bangui, Central African Republic in search of blood diamonds but under the pretense of building a third-world-saving match factory.

The real Brügger, it seems, wants to expose the actual men who participate in these abhorrent transactions, but at what cost? The film admirably addresses the moral quagmire it finds itself bogged down in by calling attention to the men who are counting on Brügger to live up to his promises of investing and creating jobs in the area. But for all the time Brügger spends darkly sending up this diplomatic culture (what with his leather boots and cigarette holder), it's hard to enjoy yourself watching The Ambassador.

The film, as you might have guessed by this point, is a documentary along the lines of Exit Through the Gift Shop and Catfish. The access Brügger gains into the upper levels of the Central African Republic government is nothing short of astonishing. He films his meetings with them in what must be the only safe style-using either a handheld camera operated by an unknown associate or using hidden cameras rigged to his person or in his apartment. Lord knows what would have happened to Brügger if one of these cameras was discovered.

It's such a ludicrous situation that one can't help but as least question the legitimacy of it all. Were these people in on Brügger's joke the whole time? Certainly not all of them, as we learn late in the film that one interviewee was found dead (though there doesn't seem to be any connection whatsoever to Brügger). But a good portion of The Ambassador's budget must have been spent on paying off these high-ranking government officials-some good, old-fashioned ""Don't kill me, please"" money.

Brügger doesn't flinch when dealing with any of these people-the mark of an outstanding performer. But one wonders how he could emotionally remove himself from these people and this situation so thoroughly. That's the mark of someone with a few screws loose. Whether you view The Ambassador as a brilliant piece of gonzo journalism or a despicable, deceptive mockumentary that manipulates third-world men and women, it's hard to argue against the film's originality. I can guarantee you won't see anything like The Ambassador this year.

"826",282,"Very boring movie. I couldn't even get halfway through it. The Possession sets out to be more of an atmospheric/creepy horror movie rather than just come out with the scares, but it fails just about every time. Very few scenes were scary or even creepy. Most just didn't leave an impact. There are a few reasons for this I think.

First is the acting. Now, it's not terrible but it's kinda hammy. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a good actor and he does alright in this role, but I think he plays too much of a caricature of a father in a horror movie rather than actually feeling like one. The daughters are way overacting. Also, I think the dynamic between Jeffrey Dean Morgan's character and Kyra Sedgwick's was a bit bizarre. Alright, so they are divorced. But the way the relationship plays is just so unrealistic. It was distracting to me because I was confused most of the time about what was going on between them. Their relationship almost felt like something in a chick flick.

Second, the music is TERRIBLE. This is honestly the worst part of the film. It was not suspenseful, too light hearted, and just didn't induce anything frightening or fearful. I was puzzled by what they were trying to accomplish. Were they trying and just failing?

Third, the ""scares"" deflate themselves. There were two scenes in particular that totally deflated the tension. The first was the moths from the box…thing. I don't know what it is. But the film establishes that something ominous will happen with this bug (meaning there will be a swarm or something). First time you see it in the box, it's a dead one, basically mummified. Later one, a live one is found in the elder daughter's room. When the father kills it, the girls reacted like teenagers from a Disney TV movie ""Daaaaddduuuh! That was so gross!! Ewww!"" Totally killed any possible tension.

Next scene, the younger daughter starts acting strangely. The family is eating breakfast and she is stuffing food in her mouth. JDM tells us to slow down and eventually yells at her to stop. She then looks at him and stabs his hand with the fork! And what was the reaction? The daughter was like ""I'm so sorry daddy!"" and he's just like ""Just go to your room."" with NO reaction at all to having his hand STABBED WITH A FORK!

And then he sees his ex-wife and they are reminiscing about something and he has no bandage, and still NO REACTION TO BEING STABBED IN THE HAND WITH A FORK! Just carried on like nothing happened at all.

At that point, I shut off the movie. It was just too distracting and took away any potential to be scary. So I give the movie 2 stars. Some of the efforts were fine. But the writing was atrocious, the acting was pretty hammy, and the music was just the worst for a horror movie.",2

"832",288,"As an exorcist connoisseur, I'll give the vast majority of the sub-genre's films a shot. And while The Possession did have a few interesting changes of note, it was largely predictable with a pay-off not worth the build-up. The movie gets right down to business with a box, etched with a Hebrew inscription, mumbling something in a foreign language, forcing an elderly woman (Anna Hagan) to twist and contort to death… so I had believed. It was actually a pretty gnarly and promising opening scene. I'll add, however, that it was a disappointment this woman didn't come back into the plot, even after they made the point of showing she was alive. The meat of the story is predictable and can be summarized as divorced father (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) struggles to connect with daughter (Natasha Calis), who becomes obsessed with, and subsequently possessed by… something in the box. Then there is a bunch of ""young white girl does progressively crazier shit because she's possessed,"" followed by her father seeking conventional medical treatment, a specialiast/professor (Jay Brazeau) of occult, a religious individual (Matisyahu) to fight spirit — pretty standard. That being said, although the ""rogue priest fighting Satan/demon"" is one of my favorite archetypes, I really enjoyed the Jewish angle and always wondered why there weren't more exorcism-like films in different religions, as so many believe in similar evil spirits. As mentioned above, freakin' bonus that — ""HaShem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe"" — Matisyahu was the exorcist. I did find it a bit comical that he had to travel all the way to Brooklyn, from I think Virginia or North Carolina(?), to find a Jew… The exorcism itself also offered something different, as there was a literal little creature inside of the girl, like a little gollum sitting snug up against her ribcage, just chillin'. I mean, this is what we've been waiting for and it just didn't deliver. It was in this weird kind of slow-motion with Matisyahu reciting the Torah in the whirlwind until the dybbuk named Abyzou (Cameron Sprague) just kind of crawls out of father (he's the possessed one at this point) and slunks back into the box. There's maybe one or two flickering fluorescent light scenes that give a little scare, but it was a meh reveal. The film ends in typical ""you haven't seen the last of me!"" fashion. I definitely cannot recommend The Possession to the general viewer, and maybe for the sub-genre fan, just to say you've seen it.",3

"843",299,"WARNING: THE FOLLOWING REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS!
A terrible movie. The first 30 minutes turned out to be pretty good, but after that, the movie became a hot mess. For many reasons:
1) THE STORY: This movie's plot is so cliche and so predictable that I knew what was going to happen before the director did. The plot is silly to say the least, and it is not very realistic nor credible. 
2) BRUCE WILLIS: I don't have a problem with Bruce Willis. But, on the contrary, I was so disappointed that he was out of commission after the first 20 minutes of the film. He really brought so much to the first act, and I think it's a shame that the filmmakers didn't use him for the entire movie. 
3)  CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Character development and personality detail is shot to hell in this movie. Even the main character doesn't have much to him.
4) LUCIA: During the movie, Will teams up with Lucia. Now, the actrice who plays Lucia is a good actrice, no doubt about it. However, she overreacted in every scene, and that got on my nerves.
4) THE SCRIPT: Let's face it. The script is bad.
5) THE VILLAIN: The villain in this movie is terrible. She has no motive to do what she does. She was not convincing. Period. 
6) ACTION: The action scenes are not even decent in this movie. Out of all the fights and chases, I think I only liked one or two scenes. I'm sorry, guys, but the action is badly directed, badly conceived and you can tell that they were putting a budget on things. In the end, the action turns out to be boring, because there was nothing new. It was just random crashing, punching, kicking, running, jumping, more running, shooting, etc. Nothing new. NOTHING. 
Only good performances from Henry Cavill and Bruce Willis saves this movie. So, it just manages to cut out two stars from me. But I would not recommend.",2
"844",300,"A pretty bad film but entertaining in that ""bad movie"" kind of way. The closing car chase was done quite well. This movie has a ridiculously good cast for what it is. Henry Cavill's American accent makes it seem his lines are dubbed, perhaps he had to redo them? Bruce Willis just mails it in as usual, thank lordy he isn't in it that long. Henry is a good actor and does a good job despite the film he's in. Weaver is good too as the baddy. A fun, bad movie. With a little more of a budget and a better director handling the scenes without action, it could have beeb a decent film. The actions scenes weren't half bad. I think this is a better movie than The Hitman's Bodyguard that I paid to see, much to my regret. At least this was free.",2

"861",317,"If the 1920s were the best of times for the city of Detroit, Michigan, the late 2000s were absolutely the worst of times. , a marvelous documentary by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, isn't exactly a tale of two cities. It's interested exclusively in profiling the worst of times in the Motor City, which is why it opens with a home getting demolished.

This home is just one of thousands across Detroit (circa 2010) that's decrepit, abandoned, and both a visual and environmental scourge on the city. The only industry thriving, it seems, is the demolition business. The UAW (United Auto Workers) is being forced to accept steep pay cuts. Restaurants are empty. The arts are suffering. It feels like the setting of a post-apocalyptic film.

Ewing and Grady's approach is in the tradition of a Pennebaker Cinéma vérité documentary insomuch as they stay completely removed from the proceedings. Yes, there are versions of your standard ""talking head"" interview, but they're all done in the moment.  doesn't feature any sets or narration, which lends a great deal of truthfulness and immediacy to the picture.

The film arguably tries to do too much, but considering it's trying to do something very broad-profile a city in ruin-it feels quite thorough. We meet Mayor Dave Bing, who's big plan is to relocate many of the city's residents into a denser population center. We spend some time with a local bar owner who's concerned, but ultimately optimistic about his city's chances. We head to an auto show to learn a little more about the electric car movement that's helping to revive the city. And we meet the leaders of the auto unions who long for a time when jobs were plentiful.

All of this adds up to a film that packs a punch and feels surprisingly complete. Of course, it isn't. A two-hour profile of a city in peril can't possibly be complete. But if feels that way, and as such, it's a supremely satisfying film-one of 2012's very best documentaries.

Alas this version, while being a massively superior movie, did not see its success reflected very well at the box office.

However, it doesn't change the fact that this film is probably the best  adaption one could possibly have hoped for.

The sprawling world of Megacity One doesn't lend itself to a standalone movie, there is just too much going on.

Luckily they spotted this and wrote a script that absolutely fitted a good  standalone story. Short, to the point and visually impressive.

The cast are excellent. Urban nails the role as usual and one could be forgiven for thinking that he's developed the ability to channel even fictional characters now. Its quite a talent to develop a character when only your chin and mouth is visible.

Lena Hedey is genuinely quite scary in her portrayal of Mama. Olivia Thirlby does an excellent job of developing a character sandwiched between a very stoic lead and a very stoic villain.

She actually does more for this film than she gets credit for...seriously, watch it and then try and imagine the same film without her.

The film is excellently paced and gives you exactly what you should want out of a  film. Plenty of action, an interesting story; and one that accepts the world it is set in rather than trying to over complicate matters with moral quandary for the viewer.

It's a claustrophobic film that lands perfectly.

The film mainly focuses on procedure and the daily beat of the main men, but provides action in an effective manner. The events leading up to the climax are muddled, but the final scenes pack a real punch. The muddle comes from the existence of a few stock antagonists that contrast in colour and depth to the the complicated and fleshed main pair. This leads, ultimately, to a film where the police force is almost canonised in favour of tackling the unnuanced ugliness of their surroundings. While putting the focus upon the human sides of police officers is by no means a negative objective, one cannot help but feel that the interchangeability and randomness of the main physical conflict detracts from what still is an immensely serviceable cop action-drama.",4

"926",382,"The pace is too slow throughout, the acting is too school boy like (warning licking of lips or gulping air to show sorrow yet actually this is what the cast do out of character when thinking of kissing trying to draw attention to their lips it's very poor) plus the film didn't get out the gear it was in. You've got nothing going on apart from a strange eerie tone and from typical teenage hormones - think about that, a lad who drives, a girl who has to look well, spending time with me another) all deflecting away from the main story which didn't come off. It's sturdy enough has some compelling themes but working from a solid template is only half the battle; the other half is filling in the details and well it fails as do the actors miserable at that. With substituting jump scares which is what the audience wanted and going flat and generic with psychological complexities that might have sold the horror. 
Admittedly Jennifer Lawrence the lead is so desirable I could eat her with a spoon but her cheap acting and over the top innocent yet strong woman look was really getting in the way of a decent watch.",2

There's a bunch of plot lines that just don't matter and I didn't care about- like all the band stuff (which she herself doesn't even seem to care about) and Tyler. It really feels like mostly a high school drama. It's really PG, barely any blood and they always cut away. So many plot holes. Also really suffers from the horror-movie-character-does-dumb-dangerous-thing-that-no-real-person-would-do trope. Some smaller gripes [SPOILERS]: Some of the dialogue is really, really dumb. Like, for example, when she goes to Ryan's house and sees a photo of the family and says, ""It must've been nice having the whole family together and having two parents."" Like, his parents are dead? His sister killed them? Who would say that? And everything he says sounds like it came out of a really cheesy romance novel for preteens. On top of that, whenever she sings it's really obvious it's not live. It sounds really recorded. When the teens trash his car and beat him up that just made no sense? Why? Why would that contact lens stick to her arm? They're usually slippery... Jennifer Lawrence does not look 17.",2
"931",387,"I enjoyed 'Trouble with the Curve'.

There are a few too many moments of cringe for my liking, renditions of 'You Are My Sunshine' included, but as a whole it's a solidly entertaining sports flick - with added love drama.

The cast are the film's major plus, with Clint Eastwood - in his first strictly acting role since the early 1990s and last to date of review - and Amy Adams naturally sticking out most. Other cast members include Justin Timberlake, Matthew Lillard, John Goodman and Scott Eastwood - the latter shares a scene with his father, which is nice.

A few different choices by the filmmakers and I'd be rating this a tad higher, but as is it's a good film - one that is worth a watch.",3

In the meantime, Timberlake pops in once in a while so he and Adams can engage in the most generic romance ever, sharing beers and enticing each other into swimming in lakes or dancing in the street. The introduction of the pitcher ex machina in the last half hour is so hamfisted it causes physical pain. Wrap it all up in a paid promotion from the North Carolina Board of Tourism, and you've got some bizarre pandering family-friendly drama boasting a weirdly high-quality range of actors in Adams, Eastwood, Goodman, and Timberlake.

The book has a lot more depth and shows the reader who Charlie is and his emotions a lot more.

Also, the book also got straight to explaining Charlie's struggles by telling the reader that Michael, Charlie's friend killed himself whereas, in the movie, it wasn't mentioned until more than halfway through. Overall, the book and movie are both great but I like how the story was told more in the book.",4

"958",414,"Perks of being a wallflower, a film directed by Stephen Chbosky in 2012 starring Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, and Ezra Miller is the coming of age movie. This film was perfectly designed, from the imagery to the actors' chemistry towards themselves and their roles. It speaks on many different levels of being a teenager, coping with death, loneliness, and the pressures and how hard trying to fit in can be. This film is truly refreshing in all aspects so much is not spoken about, but the images and scenes set up in this film provide the viewer with ‘insider' information that really keeps the viewer focused on the film. The director, Stephen Chbosky is also the author of the book version of this film, also he is the screenplay writer. The different themes are quite recongnizable and easy to catch on to: first love, drug use, homosexuality, sexual abuse and friendship. The film starts out with a freshly new freshman loner Charlie Kelmeckis (Logan Lerman) who actually carries the heavy weight of dark secrets. Luckily, unique and strong-minded seniors Sam (Emma Watson) and her homosexual stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller) take him under their wing and invites him to their friend group. Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) developed feelings for Charlie and his laid back English teacher Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) spots great potential in his work and encourages him in the best ways. The screenplay in this film is by far one of the best I have seen, it takes you on a very emotional rollercoaster. One moment you find yourself caught in a dramatic scene, then a sad one, and then funny all within seconds. This film really highlights the true feelings and how introverts go through their thought process and all the perks of embracing being a wallflower. 
The imagery and acting in this film gives a strong sense of real life. The three leads perform so many memorable performances in the film that you can't help, but to feel the emotions that they are portraying. The topic of highschool kids struggles is very cliche, yet this film does such a great job at providing realism on how it was to be a highschooler in the late 80's/ early 90's and the struggle of offbeat kids who appear to be disengaged, but  still manage to find the positive side of this and have some fun even with all of the troubles with family, social conventions, and the discovery of one's sexuality during the painful adolescent phase that everyone can relate with because everyone has or will have to go through similar phases in their lives. 
The soundtrack to the film also helps captivate the emotions that are being shown in the film, it really helps bring the film together so you get a sort of ‘vibe' for what each scene is kind of like just a presumption. This film also has some flashbacks of Charlie's past experiences which helps the viewer identify or get insight on what he went through in life and events that lead him to where he is at. The novel had a lot of buzz and was highly cherished when it was first released and some would argue that ‘the books are always better than the movie', however in this case there is no doubt that the statement is inaccurate in regards to this film. Both the novel and the film flatters each other in the best way. I personally think this is one of the best coming of age films to watch. Simply because the scenes are so intense and are very thought-provoking. Everyone fell in love with the film as they did the novel. I feel as though this is because it truly captures a little something for everyone, meaning that this film can connect people of all different kinds of backgrounds, races, and religions to its raw story. The film also has such a good group of supporting actors that help build the momentum throughout the whole movie. I feel as though with all the aspects shown in the film the imagery still has to be my favorite part of the film because it is personal and natural. I imagine most of the credit for that is due to the author because for any writer who wanted to take hold and keep the film of his novel true to the novel and become the director who also worked very hard on his own to make the screenplay for this beautiful film. A very abundant amount of  a sense of ownership and detailed  perception which really sets a very real performance of what he wants to reveal in the film. Chbosky created such raw and memorable dialogue along with some crazy good interplay between the characters that again makes the film feel that much more relatable. The film does include a lot of dark humor here and there, I feel as though that was Chbosky's way of really including those more in-depth emotions in the film. The storyline deals a lot with a person who is mentally ill and the emotional harm that was placed on him from his past experiences. 
	If I had to rate this film from 1 (being the worst) and 10 (being the best) I can honestly score this film a 9. I give this film a 9 because even though the imagery was great I felt as though there could have been more intimate scenes between the characters because that is a huge part of the highschool experience and finding your ‘funk'. I do highly recommend this film for anyone who seems stuck in their tracks at the moment and wants to reconnect with themselves. The film is so well put together and with the jokes and all the way to the upsetting parts it truly takes you on a ride with your emotions. The quotes and metaphors mentioned in the movie are also very thought-provoking and stay with you, Chbosky was very clever with how he wrote his screenplay. Again this film is very high up on my recommendation list and watching this film if you haven't already is something you should put on your bucket list.",5

"967",423,"As an adult person this movie was not for me. There were some cute parts but mostly it was a fast paced movie that didn't make a lot of sense. I couldn't believe there was any logic behind what the characters were doing most of the time.",2
"968",424,"This movie was coming on the TV, so I was watching it with my mom. There were many scenes from this movie that were so cringy I felt like my mom would get furious (I will talk about them later). She didn't say anything, but I was feeling so ashamed I was trying to hide my face. Hotel Transylvania is one of those movies that are fun to watch while they last, but the moment they are over you will have nothing to remember them for. It's a generic comedy movie, similar to Minions, except this is not a cultural phenomenon. And that's not a bad thing.
The story of this movie is pretty straightforward. Dracula's daughter has her 116th birthday so he has arranged a party for her with all the other monsters. However, a human has also sneaked into the party disguised as a monster and let me tell you, he's really, really disgusting and insensitive. And of course Dracula's daughter and he fall in love with each other because they are teenagers and that's literally what teenagers always do. So now Dracula is very angry because his family has been hiding from humans. So finally when he drives that human away his daughter gets all moody, and he's forced to get him back.
There are many good things about this movie. The animation is pretty good. The comedy scenes also made me laugh, even though most of them aren't really clever jokes their references to the monsters and the comic timing make up for it. The storytelling is also not generic at all, but rather it is more focused on showing the good parts over the otherwise usual, boring ""character conflicts"" and plot twists. I really liked Dracula in this movie. The human was also very relatable.
The bad things, however, are also pretty overwhelming. First of all, like I said, it's very forgettable. You must have figured out by now that I have already forgotten the names of all the characters other than Dracula because he is a cultural phenomenon (not because of this movie of course). That's why I have been calling the characters ""the human"" and ""Dracula's daughter"" since I don't even remember what their names were. Secondly like I said, there was too much cringe. The parts where Dracula's daughter says that she will give up on her father, someone she has been with for over a hundred years, for a snobby teenage tourist she met a couple of minutes ago even though she can't possibly be with him. And Dracula actually decided to help her, instead of slapping her and getting her on the right path. My mom is strictly for arranged marriages, so seeing those scenes with her made me feel she will say this is propaganda. Thank Satan she didn't say it.
For me Hotel Transylvania is in the same leagues as Stuart Little and Jurassic Park. Yes it was fun and I liked it and all, but I don't have the courage to either rewatch it or see the sequels. It's too tiring to watch, so I guess I won't ever talk about it after having written this review.",4

While it's not shown, Anna seems to realize that she has let her negative feelings about Toby disrupt the father-child bond.  She rectifies that, just as she rectifies her betrayal of her friend, Jem.  Meanwhile, George has gone off the rails, and that includes being an increasingly distant father and husband.  That, too, is fixed.  So, while the love-at-first-site story seems to be important, it is really not.  The only thing that bothered me about the film was that the ""hero"" (Stephen) is unfair and distant to Fiona, and why should we feel that he will be any more understanding or communicative with Anna??",4
"984",440,"I thought this movie was fantastic, with realistic portrayals of the problems and complications of relationships. As cliche as the ending was, I loved it and thought it was really sweet! I am not a huge fan on British cinema, but this was an exception to the rule!",4
"985",441,"I need to quibble with Colleen's review, because she completely missed the relationship tangles here.  Yes, the seemingly uncaring husband, mean to his wife, is also cheating on her with the female neighbor next door.  That woman has a child, from her former husband, with whom she quarrels and gets little support.  Meanwhile, the other young man (who works in the old folks home) does not live ""next door"" to anyone -- he in fact lives with a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WOMAN in another part of town entirely...she just happens to also have blonde hair, and looks a little bit like the other character.  

The uncaring, cheating husband character is NOT a psychotherapist...he is actually unemployed, is a ""house husband,"" and has been offered a job that he does not want.  The psychotherapist is a visitor to their home for one evening, who is being ""set up"" as the date for the single woman who is having the affair with the husband.

Colleen obviously did not enjoy the film, but I am wondering if her confusion about just who is who in the darn thing in a small way contributed to her negative reactions.  I found it charming and quite realistic, and was not bothered at all by the slow movement of the script, which calls for the viewer to pay attention to the subtle changes that make all of these characters more human, and more sympathetic, by film's end.

jimeddy",4
"986",442,"The plot is very weak and the flim is slow moving.  The film plods along without any genuine character development.  Rupert Graves, Anne Marie-Duffy, Phyllida Law are excellent actors completely wasted by the dull and uneventful script.   There is pointless full frontal male nudity showing the man urinating into a toilet. Scenes like this do absolutely nothing to develop the narrative development.  I don't mind nudity in films - but at least the film has to have some semblance of a plot. 

   The dull script revolves around a married couple - with the husband committing adultery with the next door neighbor - and that next door neighbor living with a commitment phobic boyfriend who does not want to marry her, nor have kids with her.   To make matters even more pathetic - the husband who is committing adultery with the next door neighbor is a psychotherapist.  He brags he earns 50 British pounds per hour (approx. $120 US dollars an hour) - but his OWN personal life is completely screwed up - he cheats on his wife -  he is an indifferent, disengaged father....when his own child is crying in the night - wailing for help - the father refuses to go help his child - the father sits and reads a book - and ignores his crying child - and THIS is a person who charges $120 dollars an hour as a pscychotherapist who tells people how to fix their personal problems?  Pathetic.

To make matters even worse - the adulterous, cheating husband actually has the nerve to invite his next door mistress over to dinner and have the unsuspecting wife prepare a dinner party for his next door neighbor mistress.  Appalling!

    The husband has no charm, totally self absorbed - it was hard for me to understand what all these women even see in this guy.  I have always been an admirer of Rupert Graves acting - he's a terrific actor - totally wasted in a weak script.

    To sum it up - this film is a snooze-fest - just a British soap opera which was made for British television Channel 4.    

   This film is certainly not the worst movie ever made - just plodding, dull script without character development.   Too bad so many excellent actors were wasted on this snooze-fest.  I would grade this film with a very weak C minus.",2

They were suburban zombies who had no purpose, no goals, no dreams... nothing that made me want to follow them or root for them.

This has ridiculously good production value for its time, is funny, and has probably one of the deepest and good characters that Kevin James has ever played.  Granted, it might be because he starts as a dirtbag and grows into a good person.

McDonagh proves again that, other than Tarantino, there is nobody else out there with a comparable ear for witty and insightful dialogue.  The film centers around Marty (Colin Farrell), a screenwriter working on a script about seven psychopaths, hampered by a persistent case of writer's block, which is a bit surprising since everyone within his circle appears to be a psychopath.

"1039",495,"Martin McDonagh has only made three films to far. This is the worst of the lot and it's still a fantastic movie. This should tell you something about the guy.

It's ""worse"" than the subversive brilliance of In Bruges or the ice-cold morality lesson of Three Billboards not because it's less clever than the former or more shallow than the latter, but simply because it's not very focused, but rather a ""scattershot"" of characters and ideas, some of them divergent and not really belonging in the same story.

Here, McDonagh practically went full meta, writing a film about Colin Farrell's Marty, a screenwriter trying to write a film about Seven Psychopaths and not knowing where to start. I'm not spoiling anything more about the plot: it's crazy, whip-smart, self-ironic in the best way possible and the dialogue as quotable as it is revealing: both about the characters and about the genre as a whole.

This film is the way McDonagh tells the world that, as a writer, he's as in love with movies as he is critical of them. Unfortunately, he does this by sometimes intentionally leaving the story aside for his own slightly self-indulgent rhetoric about tropes and form, and he does so in order to prove a series of points to the audience, but for some it might end up a little too distracting.

The acting is top-notch from virtually everyone, and the cast is filled with some impressive names. We see top form Colin Farrell and Sam Rockwell, a hilarious villainous turn from Woody Harrelson, as well as a much expected return to form from Christopher Walken. I still think that McDonagh is the only director who could ever truly tap into the well of dramatic and comedic potential that is Colin Farrell.

Therefore, Seven Psychopaths is a must see, especially for those interested in tongue-in-cheek commentaries on storytelling.",4

Are you really morally superior to anyone…or just trying to hold on to what you were conditioned to believe is morally superior behavior? Do you even love your husband…or is it just an arrangement? Key lines from the wife, ""I'm attracted to her too"", ""just don't embarrass me."" Many reviewers focus on the ""intruder"", when it was just as clear that the wife had a practiced manner of teasing, seduction, and then triumphing over issuing rejection…even with her own husband. Her own need to exercise control was her guilty pleasure through and through to the end. Could it be that the film reflected on the psychologist wife's manipulations and cultivation of her environment and people in her circle?

(2012) Nobody Walks
DRAMA

 This movie is like the much more serious version of ""Down And Out In Beverly Hills"" except it's much more entertaining as a comedy than as a drama film. Co-written and directed by Ry Russo-Young starring Martine(Olivia Thirlby) who's just arriving to Silver Lake, LA to put some sound work into a film project regarding ants.  And while there, sound guy, Peter (John Krasinski) whose married to someone Martine idolizes, her name is Julie (Rosemarie DeWitt) starts hitting on her.  And at the same time, Peter's assistant also has the hot's for her as well creating an un-authentic scenario.  The more the movie is progressing, it became more ridiculous like the worst soap opera anyone has ever saw.  The only character that offered a little bit of credibility is Rosemarie DeWitt and even she can't even save this movie.

"1052",508,"In ""Nobody Walks,"" Martine(Olivia Thirlby) travels to Los Angeles where she stays with Miriam(Rosemarie DeWitt), a psychologist and friend of a friend.  Actually, her business is with Miriam's husband Peter(John Krasinski), a sound engineer, who is helping her with her artwork.  Otherwise, everybody is busy.  Kolt(India Ennenga), Miriam and Peter's teenage daughter, is ignoring Avi(Sam Lerner) in favor of nursing a crush on David(Rhys Wakefield) while she also takes Italian lessons.  And Martine has her hands full with Billy(Justin Kirk), a particularly troublesome patient.

""Nobody Walks"" is a well-photographed film wherein I learned something about sound engineering for films.  It also sports a very good cast, especially a usually underutilized Olivia Thirlby in the lead.  It also has a sluggish pace.  That might be to cover up how little it really has to say on the subject of how women are sexually harassed everyday.  Part of that is due to a half-hearted approach that begins awkwardly enough with the opening sequence between Martine and a fellow passenger that because the movie joins them mid-conversation only serves to confuse matters.  Plus, Martine is cast in the cliched role of domestic intruder, thus implying that some of it is actually her fault.",3

James Ponsoldt has done a decent job on executing it where its short and smart editing works in its favor even though it is not his best work till date. Mary Elizabeth Winstead; at the heart of it, is surprisingly amazing in her portrayal of an alcoholic and unlike the premise, is supported thoroughly by a great cast like Aaron Paul, Nick Offerman and Octavia Spencer.  is your typical ""alcoholic"" feature with all the familiar ingredients installed by the writers to make the equation interesting and spicy as much as possible which works for the most part of it.",3
"1058",514,"After a horrible lie goes wrong for Kate Hannah (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), she finally decides she needs to do something about her alcoholism which is causing her life to spin out of control. Throughout this Movie-a-Day experience, I have already watched a number of classics (see previous reviews). I randomly sprinkled in some films I had never heard of,  being one of them. This is one hidden gem of a film that I'm so thankful it found its way on to my list.

The messages in the film aren't preached, but still manage to resonate strongly due to a powerful delivery. Kate's character shows us that it doesn't matter how you start (or the cards you're dealt in life), rather it's about how you decide--and only YOU get to decide--to finish. Kate wants to change but she has no support system as her husband is just as bad as her. In spite of the incredible adversity she's battling, she decides to go for it anyway, refusing to make excuses.

What makes this so important is the fact that Kate is a complete wreck and you recognize it almost instantly. Her life is a downwards tailspin, kind of like watching a car crash in slow motion. Her story is layered seamlessly into the film and you slowly start to understand that she never really had much of a chance to be anything other than what she became. Winstead captures the role in phenomenal fashion, aided by yet another strong performance from Octavia Spencer as Jenny. Through the two of them, we experience a powerful meaning that says doing the hard thing will always come with a sacrifice.

But to my surprise, I found Alex Cross to be only slightly worse than those original film adaptations. It still wasn’t a great movie, and I would choose many other thrillers over this one, but it appears the source material has enough solid storytelling in order to keep me interested even in a version starring Tyler Perry and Matthew Fox. That being said, I’m not surprised that this did little to inspire audiences and start up a new franchise based on James Patterson’s novels. I did like the cat-and-mouse game that goes on throughout Alex Cross. Like a chess match, it has those moments where you’re forced to question who has the upper hand, and who has thought ahead far enough to come out on top. There are a number of exciting scenes that got me invested and they did a good job of raising the stakes for our protagonist so that it was more than a job, it was personal. Where the movie falls flat is in the mystery. This kind of story thrives on investigation, and seeing how the detectives will put the clues together. Not only was the puzzle they were trying to solve uninteresting, but the way they piece it together is rudimentary and mediocre.

Unfortunately, The Sessions disintegrates into a trite, predictable, and cliche'd rom com, or drama, or comedy, or, well whatever it tries to be since it's not sure. 

The Sessions starts off on the wrong foot by distorting what sex therapy really is. Yes this was based on a true story (well, as true as what we're allowed to know about it) but if one researches sex therapy, she would know that sex therapy pertains more to one's emotional or psychological to sexual gratification than necessarily physiological. The latter would more likely be addressed by a physician, which I'll address shortly. It's somewhat rare that a sex therapist engages in intercourse with a client and even then it's well into their sessions- certainly not the first one. The film makes it appear as if a sex surrogate is there simply to provide sexual gratification to a client, for money of course, making Helen Hunt's character (despite her denial) more of a prostitute than anything. This wouldn't be quite as much of a problem had the film risen to the occasion and avoided plot holes and cliche's, which, disappointingly, it doesn't: A) The male and female leads fall for each other meaning B) Out of all the clients the surrogate has Mark just happens to be the only one she falls for thus making one wonder C) If Cheryl's husband knows she's a sex surrogate, why is he just now having an issue with it? but that doesn't matter since predictably D) The protagonist dies E) Having had sex with an attractive woman. It's the latter that really destroys the last remnant of the film's chance to be just the least bit thought-provoking. Wouldn't it have been a more interesting question the film raises had Mark had an ugly surrogate and aid respectively? It may have given rise to an idea that sorely receives any consideration: Being ugly might be just as much a hindrance to having sexual intimacy as having polio. Unfortunately, The Sessions makes its contribution to the Hollywood contention that the only people who are worth being intimate with are attractive women.

Overall, The Sessions was disappointing but, more than that, could have had the potential to be dangerous, too. Had this film debuted in 2019 and not seven years prior, it wouldn't surprise me if an incel or two taken extreme issue with it by its premise that the only barrier a man has to having (an attractive) sex partner is physical ability. I've never seen an incel in an iron lung so they may have raised that point, too.",1

"1102",558,"Though Oscar buzz has been circling Helen Hunt for her strong and fearless portrayal as Cheryl, a sex surrogate assisting in allowing disabled Mark O'Brien to experience all matters of sex with the opposite gender, as good as Helen's performance is, John Hawkes' flawlessly portrays a dry-witted, lifelong Polio victim struggling to balance his religious teachings with the natural desire to have sex. His humor and writing style bring a very palm-under-the-chin type of viewing that demands attention. The story is told very sweetly with meaningful dialogue and touching situations, even to its sad ending, which is still humorously narrated by Mark until the last line.",4

"1111",567,"After watching Chasing Mavericks, I felt a wave of motivation to do something I was passionate about.  It is an incredibly inspirational story, though many say it is unauthentic.  I believe it shows us to never give up and to fight for our dreams.  That is an important life skill and lesson everyone should learn.   The movie is based on the true story of Jay Moriarty, a 16-year old boy, and how he trained extensively to be able to surf the massive Maverick waves.  There also appears to be a christian underlying, but it is not really dug into.  When Moriarty was eight he almost drowned, but was saved by his neighbor, Frosty Hessen.  Since the incident, Moriarty has always idolized the surfer that saved his life.  One day, he follows Hessen and discovers the enormous 20-foot waves called ""Mavericks"" which were thought to be a myth.  Moriarty pleads with Hessen until he agrees to prepare him for these gigantic waves.  Hessen acts as a fatherly figure, mostly because his wife pushed him to be better, and puts Jay Moriarty through a rigorous physical and character-building training.  Throughout the movie there are many obstacles: Jay's mother is an alcoholic, his father abandoned him, and Hessen's wife died of a stroke.  These domestic dramas, however, do not drive the movie forward.  Moriarty's biggest obstacle is the waves themselves and this movie's biggest asset is the incredible surfing footage they have captured from it.  In the end, though the story is not the most intriguing, it inspires and pushes the audience to reach for their dreams.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs to believe they can accomplish anything.",4

Okay, so the movie bombed at the box office, and there was a backlash of racism by having actors portray multiple characters. Some of which were of ethnicity or gender different from their identity of origin. I believe the point of context for the entire story was the reincarnation of a soul repeatedly in a path of predestination regardless of the host body in which the soul takes form. For example, actor Hugo Weaving portrays a person who appears to be an agent of order and structure but honestly incites chaos in every manifestation. Every soul in the movie has a predetermined path to follow until their soul's mission has been completed or run its course.",5

The most exceptional movie I have seen in recent memory.  It should be a mandatory part of middle school, high school and college curriculum. 

Thought provoking both during and after the movie. Especially in 2021 where our country (and world) is no longer examining lessons from history and is going backwards in human rights.  

The rich are getting richer, middle class is dissolving, poverty is rising.  There are a growing mountain of children who are not being raised by a parent, nor a village.  They are raising themselves.

This Nickelodeon production ALMOST starts with, ""Where are my boobs?"", lmao.

A silent protagonist might be a common trope in video games, but its much rarer and more difficult to do it in movies. This is a child adventure well mixed with a coming of age story.

While Jackson Nikol (Bad Grandpa) is on his silent adventure into the a dark Halloween night, there is a nice juxtaposition in the b-plot of his sister, Victoria Justice (""Victorius') and the amazing Jane Levy (""Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist"") in their vapid search for love (/ booty) and potential social acceptance.

What's fun is that there are clear c (Chelsea Handler), d (Thomas Middleditch), e (Thomas Mann) plot lines, as well as argueable f (Riki Lindhome), and g (Johnny Knoxville) plot lines. The multi-threaded writing of this is actually really good because it's not just about ""Finding Albert"" (a good alternative title), much like ""Chasing Amy"", its about each character's self discovery: growing and adapting to their adversity and situations.

That's right, the second Nickelodeon movie to be rated PG-13 but it never feels like it's trying to be edgier than, say, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. You know, where Bikini Bottom becomes a terrifying dystopia, a bounty hunter is hot on our heroes' trail and they even ALMOST DIE, nearly traumatizing many who grew up with the sea-sponge, myself included.

The movie has a pretty one-note premise with messages I saw coming a mile away. I think it would have been fine if the movie was geared towards young kids but it's too crude for that audience, yet it's not very effective for older teens or adults. It feels like it is unsure of who its audience is and as a whole was a messy movie, despite some heartwarming moments near the final act.

Daniel Craig delivered again a fucking blast of a performance. Somehow our favorite secret agent got even more badass and charmy in this one. Javier Bardem, tough I prefered the Mads Mikkelsen villain, did a pretty good job too. Judi Dench thank you for showing us your talents, we all love M.

When talking about cinematography and camera work it's where i really loose it. Roger Deakins is a master at what he does and is probably the best cinematographer alive. He fucking rules. Every single shot was incredibly well put togheter. The colors, the mirrors, the reflections, the big explosions, the faces, the shadows, everything had so much care and so much work behind it. Deakins is the real MVP.

Update...I'm torn on ranking this one. I know some (such as The Big Picture crew) look to this as the best Bond film, other (James Bonding) seemed to have more critiques.

The collaboration of Eli Roth and Rza created a unique, action packed, and violent film.   The action is virtually non-stop.   The list of stars and familiar faces in this one is large.   We see in Cung Le and Daniel Wu the foundations for the, later to come, Into The Badlands, series.    Byron Mann is great as Silver Lion, and we see the formation of his character for Wu Assassins.    Lucy Liu, and many of the scenes remind us of Kill Bill.   There is a lot here if you are paying attention.  Russell Crowe plays a deadly Westerner in a memorable role.

The RZA isn't exactly a compelling lead character, but you do root for him as he is charismatic, largely due to the RZA's natural charisma, and from his work behind the camera (as the writer/director), his palpable love of the classic Kung-Fu Genre is clear.  If you liked the old Shaw Brothers styles of films and would like to see a Hollywood tribute to them (particularly some of the less grounded-in-reality ones), this movie will certainly entertain you if just for a single 90 minute viewing.

"1171",627,"Ah, so many found footage movies, so little time.  A genre that a lot of people hate for no real reason whatsoever.  Its positives are the fact that it has allowed aspiring filmmakers to make a film on the cheap.  The negatives are the fact that there are a lot of lazy filmmakers who don't use the style in a creative or clever fashion.  I say this a lot, and I'll continue to say it, but focus on the content of the movie and not whether or not the film has a visual style that you find appealing.  I'm not saying that the visual style should be exempt from criticism, clearly, but just focusing on that makes it hard to take those reviews seriously.  Take this movie, as an example, while it's not without its faults, it's a surprisingly solid little found footage flick.  One of the things I liked, of many, is the fact that the flick focuses on something that's very real.  I don't think it's something that most of us will ever live through, but it's a believable enough concept.  A group of friends, who are making an audition tape for this reality show, go on a drive that obviously turns into a drive that will change their lives forever.  While driving down the highway, they see an Amber Alert on one of the billboards describing a car along with its license plate number.  Nate and Samantha then notice a car fitting the description, right down to the license plate.  They then decide to follow the car, more at Sam's insistence since Nate is a little apprehensive about following the car, fearing that it might be a misunderstanding.  They call and notify the cops, naturally, while still following the guy.  This is where the movie lacks some 'realism'.  In a lot of these case, the authorities take this very seriously and they're on top of that shit almost immediately.  Either that or they're on the phone with the people following the car.  The cops do none of that in this movie.  It's, essentially, all up to Nate and Sam to save this little girl.  I will say that if you hate characters yelling at each other, as Nate and Sam do here, then you will absolutely hate this movie.  And I get that complaint, their constant bickering can really be exasperating at times.  It gets on your nerves fairly quickly.  But, on the flip side of that, you can argue that it's justified in the situation that Nate, Sam and Caleb (Sam's teen brother, the cameraman) find themselves in.  They stand to be the last chance that this little girl has, if it turns out that she was indeed kidnapped by a pedophile.  A lot of the arguing gets a little redundant, as how many times can you make the same point of doing the right thing and being this girl's last chance of survival.  Or what would Nate do if it was Sam or Caleb in that same situation.  They say this over and over and over.  And this isn't really that long of a movie.  I still found it interesting as Sam gets to see layers of Nate that she never thought she'd see.  Like, for example, Nate saying that he doesn't care what happens to the little girl, as he doesn't want them to get drawn in deeper.  The movie does a great job, and I do mean great, at keeping things supremely tense.  There's very real consequences at play here if Sam and Nate's help backfires.  Or if they lose the car they're following.  The movie being as short as it was helps them to keep things movie.  They never stick with one scene longer than they absolutely need to.  Of course it comes out that the guy was, indeed, a pedophile (this is after they talked to him and he seemed like a normal guy and they went their separate ways).  They find their way to his house where they attempt to rescue this girl.  Things don't turn out perfectly for Sam and Nate (in the understatement of the year), but they do accomplish what they set out to do.  I thought Summer Bellessa and Chris Hill, Sam and Nate respectively, were actually really good in their roles.  One of the things they nail down pat is the fact that they feel like they've been friends for a long time.  So it's believable when Nate refuses to listen to Sam's pleading, he cares for her and her brothers and he doesn't wanna put them in any more danger than he probably already has.  I know they didn't have a gigantic budget, but films like this are better with unknown actors.  It helps with immersion and suspension of disbelief.  And I'm not saying that this is the most immersive found footage film out there, but the actors' authenticity certainly helped get its point across.  Yes, this isn't the smartest film out there.  And no, the characters aren't always the most intelligent of people.  Taking that into consideration, however, I found this to be quite a solid experience.  It's not gonna be an easy movie to like for some, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  And that's what matters.",3
"1172",628,"Amber Alert is a decent low budget concept to add to the found footage genre and its final third is nail-biting in its suspense but stupid character decisions, awkward pacing and Summer Bellessa's incessant moronic shrieking keep it from being recommendable. ",2

Ótimo desfecho, trágico, desalentador, pouco espirituoso, zero redenção, mas amamos a realidade nua e crua, exagera, mas sincera…",5
"1186",642,"Wow, was I just deeply absorbed into every single minute of this film.

I was definitely not expecting this film to be this good. The film starts off with Dr. Jeffrey Lang (Tobey Maguire) narrating about the titular ""details"" of the film to look out for later in the movie and while they are plentiful, they're manageable and really have you paying close attention to the movie.

While the script might not be very good, outstanding performances from every single member of this cast help you overlook it. Jeff (Tobey Maguire) and his wife Nealy's (Elizabeth Banks) relationship is evidently tenuous and strained but they have enough chemistry to make you believe that they still both deep-down truly care about one another.

Jeff's relationship with Lincoln (Dennis Haysbert) is surprisingly heartfelt and believable and I even got teary-eyed when Jeff revealed that he was going to be donating his kidney to his dying self.

Without getting into the details of this film (no pun intended) the various acts of infidelity that Jeff's character performs have you as the viewer hating his character but at the same time wondering how deep into the abyss he'll fall without informing his wife. There's also a particularly tense scene near the middle of the film where a character confronts Dr. Jeff at a bridge and does something unthinkable to have you and Dr. Jeff himself thinking about how low he's fallen. This then leads to an attempted act of redemption on Jeff's part to get his life back together before a sudden and completely unexpected turn for the worse. The more solemn than happy ending wraps things up nicely and has you wondering (like the characters) as to what the hell just happened.

The film never drags on and the colors of the film are cool and relaxing (in stark contrast to the film itself). The acting here is fantastic as well and it solidified my opinion that Tobey Maguire with his expressive face is a generational talent, and any scene with him yelling in it is genuinely frightening and deserves an Oscar-nomination. It's a shame that he's taken up producing instead recently, hopefully he'll return to the A-list with Damien Chazelle's upcoming film ""Babylon.""

This film had me flustered, stressed, laughing, weirded out, and teary eyed in the span of only 1 hour and 40 minutes.",5
"1187",643,"This is a morally ambiguous move which may explain the bad ratings.  The directing is OK and the script is not a bad one, but Americans like moral closure, not fuzziness or dilemmas.

We want to see a piano fall on Maguire, and we do, but it's a sham. In ""real life"" he gets away with ""murder"". Problem is, that is real life. Justice is rarely served.",4

"1190",646,"This movie was insanely frustrating, but somehow I was moderately satisfied by the end.",3
"1191",647,"Strengths: There was a quirky element to this film that worked for it. It was the kind of thing where something that we shouldn't laugh at happens, yet it turns out to be quite funny.  The story takes some truly wacky and unexpected turns, that keep you on your toes. I also think this was one of the better Tobey Maguire (Jeff) performances. He played well off Elizabeth Banks (Nealy), Dennis Haysberg (Lincoln), and Laura Linney (Lila).

Weaknesses: While Banks does solid work, I think it was a role that was probably better suited to a different kind of actress. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something didn't click the way it probably should've. I found myself wondering why Kerry Washington (Rebecca) and Ray Liotta (Peter) were even cast. They were kind of just there and added nothing to the film. Also, while I appreciated some of the plot twists, they did go into ""completely unrealistic"" territory.

Overall: This isn't a bad movie, it just doesn't veer into anything above average. The performances are mostly fine and the plot keeps you engaged, but it takes things a bit too far. When things feel too far-fetched, you get pulled out of the story and that's not good.",2

"1194",650,"A mediocre, at times good film that could have been great. I felt that the script was formulated with great care for the music. The musical sequences are wonderful (contrasting to the usual horrific ones we see all too often where the actors clearly haven't been given any instruction), and the film felt as if it were written by and for musicians... for the most part. I do wish that the film had remained about the music, as the original storyline concerning an aging cellist struggling with Parkinson's was by far the strongest. As the film progresses, though, it becomes a melodrama built upon the backdrop of these professional classical musicians, rather than a preferred inversion that would have improved the experience for me.

Let's keep with the positives. Christopher Walken was excellent, playing a sane man and a voice of reason to the growing drama around him. Hoffman performs with a reliable commitment. I thought that his desire for love, affection, and acceptance manifested into his dealings with other characters in an intelligent form. Keener and Ivanir do alright for themselves, but the story falls apart when the focus falls from Walken. The infidelity plotline involving Keener and Hoffman's marriage seemed serviceable as long as it didn't take center stage, but the romance between Ivanir and Poots was nonsensical and deserves a more full dissection.

I could not stand Poots's character. At first I thought it might be her accent feeling unnatural, as a Brit playing an American. Then, I thought that perhaps her unnuanced, careless, boring performance as a snarky teenager was the problem. Eventually, I just realised that her character was written with none of the nuance, motivation, or path that I desired. She's simply just there. Every time we see her on the screen is time wasted. Who cares at all about her simply creepy romance with a man who has been part of a string quartet with her parents before she was born. We have no real buildup to the relationship; we are just supposed to lap up the drama like any soap opera fan on the hunt for brainless entertainment. 

The film's resolution was nothing of the sort. We have no idea of the termination of the conflicts between Daniel and Robert or Robert and Jules. You could stick any of the main four together and have no sense of where the character arcs in relation to one another completed. This is not a problem when it adds depth to the film to allow the viewer to assume for themselves and rejoice in creative freedom, but here it felt lazy. We are forced to spend more time on the melodrama away from Walken than with the music, but the film begins and ends with this music. Does this mean that we should not care about the characters, and only the music? Clearly not, because far too many of the conflicts could take place with any profession, characters, or settings. This film could have been so much more.",3

Is the drowned boy a dream? Who is he? I don't know how he'd fit into the plot, and he might confuse an audience when the next scene is a funeral procession, presumably for Gino and Sabrina's mom.

Although I did understand what it was all about, I decided to take a look at the sequel also, since I found so many things to like in that movie, especially the characters and the comic timing. And I'm really glad I decided to make that decision. Despicable Me 2 is, in every way, better than the first movie. Although I don't really like animated movies which don't hold much value other than giving the laughs, this movie is actually much better than most such movies.
The thing I really like about Despicable Me 2 is that it is able to expand over the story that the prequel did. Normally in animated movies that are just made for the laughs, the sequels don't work so hard to make the story. They just bring back the villain, and bring in more explosions. There are also characters who are suddenly pulled out of nowhere, which isn't something that happens over here. This movie knows it's just made for the laughs, yet it takes the effort of making it more complicated than it needs to be.
Dr Nefarious retires in this movie. I really liked him. He seemed to be something like a grandfather to all the Minions. I still remember the scene where the Minions are working and one of them wears a fruit dress and dances singing something like ""Eto hola macarena kala kala macarena"" (I don't know what it was, but it was so memorable). Then there's the scene where Gru is invited to the secret agency where the two Minions laugh at Bottom.
The thing I like about Despicable Me is how many characters there are to love. There's the Minions who are so adorable, there are the three daughters whom I feel like pulling cheeks of, there are the new characters in the form of the Mexican man and Gru's wife. They all have characteristics and emotions, and the movie takes time to explore over all of them. In live action movies this is easy since their runtime is higher, but in animated movies where the runtime is less than two hours, this is actually a pretty big deal.
Although Despicable Me 2 isn't exactly what I'd call a memorable movie, it is fun while it lasts; something it promises of being. It's not something that you're gonna carry in your memory for the rest of your life, but that's probably what makes it so much fun to rewatch. It's a definite recommendation for anyone who is looking forward to watching something fun for the weekend with children.",5

Beautifully played out story - good twist in the middle of the movie, beginning of second half was slightly dragged however. Meaningful movie - something that's lacking in Bollywood these days. Great dialogues by Anurag Kashyap. Good music. Movie did not receive the reception it deserved in the box office.

Ranveer Singh falling from the tree towards the end of the movie wasn't shot well. Unsure why he pulled out his gun in the end but maybe he had lived his life to the fullest.",4

"1275",52,"One of the best biopics.

Although whole India was aware and proud of our flying sikh, this movie made us aware of the struggle, ambition, hard work Milkha Singh had throughout his life. Farhan Akhtar has nailed it in his acting. Story, Screenplay, music, every element is just perfect. I would recommend this movie to each and every human on this planet, one of the best motivational stories.",5
"1276",53,"Unlike most normies, I already knew who Milkha Singh was. I had heard about his losing in the Rome Olympics, and the moment I began watching the biopic I felt it was just going to be a whitewash of his image. All his actions will be justified. But as the film progressed I realised this is not the case. This is one of the best biopics I have ever seen. Considering there are barely any good biopics (and also the fact that I hate biopics), there wasn't any competition anyway, but it did set a bar.

Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a coming of age biopic. It begins at the time just before independence and carries on to the 1962 Asian Games. Milkha's entire family is murdered during the partition and he goes to join the army. From there he gets fascinated to be an athlete. He is never shown to be a good guy. He has his own share of flaws, even though his intentions are never to hurt anyone. He just ends up doing things he should not do being the naive villager that he is. Finally he grows out of that personality and becomes the Flying Sikh that he is known as.

The score, the cinematography, the acting, everything is on point. Farhan Akhtar looks very much like the young Milkha Singh. Normally when we think of the time of the independence we only think of very cultural, conservative families. We never think of some fun loving loafer that Milkha was. Milkha Singh has himself confessed that this film is mostly true, so it's not like the makers of this film are just showing all that to market their film. The only problem I have with this film is the overuse of details. I understand that this is Milkha Singh's life being depicted as a person and not as an athlete, but there were many storylines that went absolutely nowhere like a swimmer who tried to kiss him, or what finally happened of Biro.

I'd say this is undoubtedly one of the only good biopics Bollywood has ever made, the others being MS Dhoni: The Untold Story and Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai (if that counts). Normally I completely trash biopics, but not this one. This one has made me have really high expectations from all biopics.",4
"1277",54,"It was a great film but no need from the filmmaker Rakesh Omprakash Mehra to dig deep into the athlete's personal affairs which distracted the viewers from his achievements.",4
"1278",55,"While many of the nuances in Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's sports biopic 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag', are undone towards the period approach of the film, it all is bound again by the solid performance and dialogue of its principle strength: Farhan Akhter. The actor delivers a beautiful performance as the Sikh sprinter despite the lacklustre writing. Thankfully, the music also propels the game in the correct direction. 
But doesn't any of it not matter, when the direction is insipid and boring? Nevertheless, what keeps the film astoundingly afloat is it's maturity. The film isn't a childish and whimsical portrayal and gives us a bolder picture to the portrayal of the flying Sikh. Thankfully, the heart's also in the right place.",3

"1283",60,"Based on the life of Milka Singh a.k.a. The Flying Sikh, this movie unexpectedly turned out to be an amazing movie. Farhan Akhtar gave his best performance as an actor yet and was the life of the movie. The movie wouldn't have been same if it wasn't for him and the brilliant direction by Rakeysh Mehra.",5
"1284",61,"A dull, softhearted tragedy that succeeds only in vilifying the police.  Nothing stood out to me about it other than knowing the exact ending from the start... and not because I was familiar with the story, I wasn't.  Not sure what the hype was about and why critics lauded it so highly.  If I liked the police I'd have scored it lower.   Late 2021, I just don't care about any of these stories anymore.

"1288",65,"The gripping true story of 23 year old Bay Area resident Oscar Grant lll, his last day and the events that led to his untimely demise on the first day of 2009. Oscar was a man struggling to ‘make it out' , where your from where he's from and look how he does it can seem like an impossible battle just to rise up from impoverish beginnings, just trying to find a suitable and grown up job is like being stuck in quick sand. Fresh off a jail sentence this young man is actively trying to change his life around for his family, his girlfriend Sophina, and their young daughter Tatiana. With losing his job two weeks prior it almost seems inevitable for a man like him to escape a career in the drug trade, he vows this year to do better, he has to do better people rely on him. With his mothers advise Oscar decides to head to the city for New Years festivities on the subway, as most would believe a night of drinking is safer when nobody has  to sober up to drive. This would lead them to an untimely chain of event that would forever shake Oscar's family, friends and the Bay Area to it's very nucleus. 

Although Oscar is a deeply flawed and troubled young man nobody can help but to root for the guy. Michael B Jordan truly shines in his first top billed role. Director Ryan Coogler had a vision with this and took the bull by it's horn just a few short years after the fact, which was amazing, it's a story that needs to be told, it can help most understand a little better the type of privilege we actually have. This is just another sad example of Police these days and the fear most have of people of color no matter how upstanding they truly are. It also helped Coogler immensely that he's a born and raised Bay Area resident, giving us the most unadulterated take of a serious problem. It's sad and can cause some mental afflictions, but above all else everyone should see this, it's a story that needed to be told.",5
"1289",66,"A very good film about an upsetting true event.

Michael B. Jordan (Oscar) nails it in the lead role, he gives an impressive portrayal. There are a few other good performances, the most notable to me being from the excellent Octavia Spencer (Wanda) - yet to see a bad showing from her. Melonie Diaz (Sophina) is notable, too.

The story is told in a straightforward but still highly meaningful way, there are a couple of times where you could argue it's too on the nose but even then it still gave me that dreadful feeling in the pit of my stomach. The ending, meanwhile, is tough to forget due to Spencer's performance.

'Fruitvale Station' is well worth a watch.",4
"1290",67,"This thing put me into a mood. One of the most thought provoking films that I have seen from the past 10 years. The fact that it's still relevant today, man. I don't know what to think. Strong performances, cinematography, and the buildup itself was fantastic, but those last 20 minutes were what made me give it 5 stars. Highly recommend this film to pretty much anyone with an actual heart.",5
"1291",68,"I knew this was likely going to be a tough watch so all the more credit to Coogler, and in his debut nonetheless, that this still hit as hard as it did.

The performances all felt tangibly human and believable to me even when the events and interactions leading up to this tragic crime may have been a tad over dramatized for some. The landing was also stuck here, as tough as that is to type through blurry eyes...

The last twenty minutes or so were thankfully, still really difficult to watch, creating a flurry of emotions from anger, to confusion, to sadness. I say ""thankfully"" as I wouldn't be surprised if audiences have become more desensitized to stories of injustice and abuse since nightmares such as this have seemingly become more commonplace on the evening news and, also thankfully, in the public consciousness in the years since.

It is definitely no shock that Coogler and Jordan have seen the success they have in their careers and credit to both for undertaking such a meaningful project so early. 8.5/10",4

"1318",95,"""The Conjuring"" is a high class horror film, its hard not to be scared by it, we care for the characters and the story is compelling enough to make you feel interested the whole time.

Based on true life events, Ed and Lorraine Warren are paranormal investigators set to help a family terrorized by a demon, said to be one of the most terrifying cases of their lives which they hadn't shared with anyone...until now.

First of all, I loved that it takes place in the 70's, I agree completely with director James Wan's point of view that it is almost impossible to make a horror film set in the present. For example, the teenage daughters of the haunted family would be taking pictures of the demons with their iphones and would be posting them on posting them on instagram, basically the demons would turn into the victims and the humans would be the bad guys.

The movie isn't perfect though, there are a few plot holes in it, but still it does have some great scares in it that had me jumping out my seat and I liked the way it builds up tension and lets us know the characters before it starts with all the craziness. Not only is the movie set in the 70's, but it also has the feel of a 70's horror film, with slow zooms and filming styles you wouldn't expect from a modern movie. I really believe James Wan has outdone himself with this movie, I'll even go so far to calling it the scariest movie I've seen in my life. Thank you James Wan for this great movie and good luck with Fast & Furious 7.

I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great horror film, I guess it gives the feeling audiences must have felt when watching ""The Exorcist"", ""Don't Look Now"", or Poltergeist"" for the first time.",5

Sometimes she is not aware of what is real and what is a dream and she has to take medication to stabilize. Not only that, but we also see the distinction between rich and poor in this movie. Despite losing everything, the main character Jasmine still wants to regain her rich life. A movie that speaks of many problems in life. The actors are all good, and the most special is still Cate Blanchett. That's why she won so many awards thanks to this movie, especially the 2014 Oscar for the best actress.",4

The premise isn't that inventive and no one actually looks like they're high school-aged, but these are things I have already overlooked in other similar movies.

The movie is saved by Aubrey Plaza, whose perfect comedy timing and consistently odd delivery generate the vast majority of the film's laughs.

The idea that the CIA go around killing everyone without any consequences is beyond laughible. Similarly, the Navy trying to kill a fellow member of personnel was pure stupidity. There was the typical unnecessary sex scene early on. The plot twist about how the DEA woman was in bed with the Navy guy was predictable, like several other plot points. The main characters managed to break into a Navy base without being killed or arrested. The two main characters survived the final shootout despite being shot at from all sides and having no cover besides floating dollar bills. The list goes on and on. To make matters worse, the characters were generic, unlikeable, and received no development. The acting was far from the best, the pacing was fine if you like being overstimulated by action scenes, the comedy was unimpressive, the cinematography and visual effects were average, and the soundtrack was completely forgettable.

I watched this because the reviews said it was just beyond awful. 

It's just beyond awful.

James Deen is like watching... well, like watching a porn actor read awful scripted lines with exactly one emotion: cocky douchiness.  Lindsay Lohan looks like... well, like a former Mouseketeer turning tricks for smack.  The writer is like... like... there is no simile for this, except someone putting his own testicles into a pencil sharpener and threatening himself to turn the handle a little more if he doesn't say something, anything, that's bone-stupid.

Plot: boring irritating people do boring irritating things and are bored and irritated with each other.

After watching, I took out my eyes and ran them through the washing machine eight times.",1
"1383",160,"Don't believe the negative reviews. I just picked this up used DVD. Lohan is really good, and Deen plays his character really well. The cinematography is good, if a bit non-conforming in the overall visual feel of the movie. It was an indy film, probably nobody got paid good money for an overall art direction feel to it. Get over it. Its a tale of a chick hanging on and a guy with a trust fund supporting her. They work that out thru online hookups that get filmed. She does people, he does people. It gets filmed. Welcome to Hollywood. Its not great, but its not as terrible as the reviews would have you believe. If u wanna stream it from somewhere, or u find it in a bargain bin - GRAB IT. Its worth a watch",4
"1384",161,"So this was a notorious project because of the presence of the notorious Lindsay Lohan.

The thing is it is not a horrible movie. It's not a great movie for sure and someone else would have been better in the role LL plays in the movie, type wise, but she's OK if a bit sad and puffy looking, not great for someone in her mid-20s. But maybe on second thought appropriate for the role of a fading Hollywood woman with a very dim future.

It turned out the most notorious person in the movie is the male lead, James Deen. He came from porn where he performs bisexually, I have not seen any of these movies. He is one of the few contemporary male porn performers with name recognition. The gossip goes that he was brought into the project via Bret Easton Ellis who wanted him.
He is a little weak but good enough in the role even though there was no reason that a porn actor had to do this, there is not that much sex on screen in the movie. He does bring a definite smarminess to the role. I kept seeing him in Overexposed: The Anthony Weiner Story.
Anyway, he plays a bratty LA mega trust fund guy who produces movies. Lohan plays his girlfriend who is basically doing what Charlie wants which is mostly be involved with hook-ups with other people which he likes to record on his phone. They have an encounter in which she gets him to do something with another man and around the same time he thinks that she is seeing someone else who he doesn't know about. All this causes a blow out of his need to control her resulting in nasty wayward brutal emotions.

The question is: Is James Deen basically playing himself and are the nasty scenes in the film, brutality to women, reflective of his actual life? (He has since been accused of brutality toward women by a couple of victims.) 
And: Did Ellis know this and for that reason put him in the movie?

Paul Schrader has had a really brilliant career. I hope he gets to make another movie after this.

The themes in the movie, well worth looking into, are more successfully explored in an older movie Star 80 by Bob Fosse. An excellent move.",3

Part of the attraction for me about space films is the space scenes and the interiors of the space ships. But it seemed to me that they sort of skimped on that in this film. 

There was also some confusion about who was where while the lander was on Europa. I believe James was on the main vessel, orbiting the moon when he was lost. After all, he floated away into space as he died. But they didn't make that very clear. 

There also wasn't really much to the plot. People just kept dying one after the other, then they finally got back into touch with Earth, only to have everything go to pot again. Not much of a story there. Interesting in its own way, though. 

You also never really get to know any of the characters or anything about their families waiting for them at home. So, if you're looking for a good sci-fi film, check out Passengers or Interstellar or maybe 2010.",3

But I can also see how the rest of the people would feel left out, feels that popular kid are just over glorified, and feel resentment.

The movie isn't even that long for Bollywood standards but I started to feel like it would never end. I thought the actors did what they could but the script was not strong at all, and no caliber of actors could have changed that.

STORY (1/1)

A common man's slow process of becoming his people's leader is the story of . The story is very similar to The Godfather's, Nayagan's and so on. But, it is a valid one-liner story. It does not complicate audiences and prone to loopholes. The tough part is the execution of this one-liner into a feature length movie. Director A.L Vijay has pulled it off quite well.

SCREENPLAY (0.7/1)

The transformation process of the common man has been shown in a very unhurried pace. This adds class to the overall movie. In fact,  shows the process mainly, because the protagonist only becomes the leader in the last scene. The slow pace suggests that the movie is a commercial drama instead of an action thriller. This worked well because Mr. Director is the best in it. Songs were placed in their rightful positions. The first half traveled in a sweet and sugar coated story line. The second half became dry and draggy for a moment but picked up its pace without taking a long time. Although minute, but there were 1 usual cliche (hero doesn't get shot when bullets fly around) and 2 logic defying scenes (antagonist hides in the prison cell without being noticed by police and escaping from armed polices in a van) which were very transparent to me. I do not know why A.L Vijay chose to picture Thalaiva Thalaiva song with people hailing the leader. It has been a very long time since such picturization came out, and it turned out to be fake and cheesy. He could have just let the song as narration like how he did for half of the song.

DIALOGUES (1/1)

Powerful dialogues have been pillars for . The idea of using a theme dialogue which goes: 'Ithu ottha vazhi pathai. Oru thadavai namma kaiyiku katthi vanthuchina, onnu kaakum, ille alikum' is brilliant. It describes the entire movie in a sentence.

CINEMATOGRAPHY (1/1)

Nirav Shah, as usual has leveled a movie several notches higher with his cinematographic skills. The angles and the type of lens he chose to portray different moods were apt. One should watch out for the way he threw a different light on Sydney, Australia in the first half of the movie.

EDITING (0.5/1)

Although overall editing was good, but Anthony could have scissored the movie at many points and made it even shorter and compact. 3 hours is a lengthy movie duration. Sound editing could have been continuous at certain places without being abruptly stopped.

PERFORMANCE (1/1)

Vijay plays two distinct characters. This guy is becoming younger each movie he acts. As an actor, he has improved immensely. His bubbly character in the first half and the serious one in the second half were properly carried out. He emotes perfectly too. Sathyaraj did full justice to his role as the people's leader and a dad. Santhanam is becoming more than a comedian in movies nowadays. Actresses are always given meaty roles in A.L Vijay's movies, and  is not exception. Amala Paul did a good job as a lover and police officer. Overall, everyone did a very good job under the cap of the movie's genre.

CHARACTERIZATION (0.8/1)

Vijay's and Sathyaraj's character were well justified. Amala Paul's sudden change of character was a good twist, but one doubts whether a police officer would go around romance and dance for the sake of investigation. But well, its a commercial drama and all that is justified as well. Reasons behind Ponvannan's character turning bad could have been explained further",5

"1450",227,"This movie lined up almost perfectly with my level of interest in presidential history; it hits some of the highlights of each administration and then moves onto the next one in a way that leaves the over-two-hour runtime feeling incredibly brisk the whole way through. Forest does a tremendous job here; the supporting cast was at least fun to point at when we recognized somebody, though I'm not usually a fan of under-utilizing good actors the way the movie required. This is particularly superior to next year's Selma, which got a Best Picture Oscar nomination while this one did not.

In one scene, JFK tells our protagonist, Mr. Gaines (Forrest Whitaker), that, after witnessing the horrors rained down on The Freedom Fighters, ""I get it,"" that is, the pain of African-Americans. As a White man who's lived through decades witnessing society's indifference and abuse of Blacks, I have to say - especially after ""The Butler"" - there's no way I truly ""get it,"" as I'm not Black.

"1455",232,"A powerful and moving film. Historically, the film is not particularly accurate, but I only take chagrin with such liberties when they detract from the tale being told (or seem totally arbitrary). While Eugene Allen only had one son (who was not a Black Panther) and his parents did not experience what they did in the film, the intent here is really to make Cecil Gaines and his son avatars for all the different shades of suffering and opposing ideas during this period in black history. While the Allens may not have experienced all of these things, many in America certainly did.

Some of the Presidential portrayals (particularly Nixon for me), were not quite there, but the central roles are acted very well, particularly Forest Whitaker. The film doesn't go anywhere truly unexpected, but the story it tells is still important, and will remain important. I find it particularly admirable that the film recognizes the contribution of the more quiet among humanity, who nevertheless are causing as much to change behind the scenes, as those who fight in the streets.",5

"1461",238,"This is a tricky movie for me to rate and review since I am one of the people who saw the 2015 biopic prior to this.  One makes him out to be one way, one makes him out to be another... the truth is likely somewhere in the middle or the complete opposite of what the middle would be.  That out of the way, I guess that it then comes down to judging this simply as a movie about the founder of a globally renown computer company that makes it's presence known in the life of billions of people every day.  If that is the case, there is no reason to like the titular character despite it being able to garner some sympathy for him only for him to throw it away every chance he gets.  I think this movie bet on people walking away liking it because  gets the last laugh.  I'm not laughing at the tactics of any of these characters.  Not only is there not much reason to like the character, but there's no one to really counter that either.  I never thought computer programming was a business of cutthroats and double crossing.  Without likable characters or a clear focus and direction of where it is going or what it is saying or building towards(other than what is already known prior to viewing) it just seems kinda like propaganda of some sort.  If it is propaganda then I think it's appalling for the line it is selling to weak, vulnerable, and trusting people.",2
"1462",239,"I enjoyed this film and I think it's a little underrated. It captures the 1970s well and it feels believable not least because all of the characters bear a striking resemblance to their real life counterparts.

"1469",246,"Spoilers: This takes off on the old saw: Men and women can't be friends (either they become lovers or go kaput). And also, there are hazards of just living together (the house is built on sand, not rock, if, indeed, marriage is rock). The premise is interesting, co-workers at a brewery with food and party service, men and a woman, are buddies in and after work, with truly funny dialog, kibitzing, laughing it up at work, a bar and in houses. The fundament is that Olivia and boyfriend Ron are friends of Jake and girlfriend Anna. Olivia is the fun-loving worker everyone likes, as she likes them all. While Jake is the same,  he and Olivia are on the same wavelength, more than the others, it seems, also eating lunch together regularly and cracking up each other. When the two couples spend a weekend in a cabin by the beach, who's with whom gets shook up a bit, and the relationships both seem to be headed for rough water and maybe the rocks. Are Olivia and Jake just friends or more? Jake with ball cap and beard has Anna, who at first seems  quiet and a little mousey, if funny, but shows us later that women are not just determined, but also so magnetic that they are the ones with the power, despite the bluster and testosterone of males. The flaw of this piece is that with a face like Olivia's -- truly one of the most attractive in film history in my book -- she seems to be somewhat at loose ends, somewhat unconfident, as when Ron ends the relationship and she later begs him to come back to her. You'd think the slobbering male masses would be lined up outside her door pounding away, and one of her co-workers actually was. But this piece is modern, accepting the idea that a woman is way more than how she looks, is very deep and complicated, and like Olivia here, despite her cloying bid to get back with boyfriend, finally makes it clear that she now likes her freedom, power, decision-making and ability to sleep with whomever, more than some need to glom onto some guy romantically. Despite the rough relationship spots, this had a funny and soft, considerate, civilized, polite feel in young people who liked to keep everything light and enjoyed one another (I bet some was ad-libbed). An example was that once Olivia and Jake figured out that they really shouldn't be together after a defining fight, they patched up things at lunch at work without a word in a funny way, making clear their relationship was still good despite rough spots, and though Anna and Jake had patched up their relationship. Nobody had marriage or kids yet, so a whole other adult undertaking was in the future -- or not. Olivia is a standout movie gem, in front of or behind the camera.",4

The reason for their trip is unclear. It seems to mostly be about Mitchell wanting a temporary escape from his tedious life of work, marriage, and child raising. Carter is a slacker, an unemployed writer. The two are obviously old friends. They talk a lot about life choices, jabbing and insulting other as old friends do.
When the breakdown happens, things get strange. First of all, it appears that Carter deliberately sabotaged the truck. Why? A couple of cars pass by, but for reasons left unsaid here, the two don't get help. And there's no cell signal at their location.
With the two having no water and no food, the middle section of the film is typical survivalist fare. But the final act picks up momentum rapidly and leads to an ambiguous ending—an appropriate one.
I can't consider this to be a great movie, but it does have its merits. Both actors throw themselves into their parts. These guys definitely earned their paychecks.

"1507",284,"""The truth hurts...but only when it's supposed to.""

The truth is, the ""I'm shocked"" virtue-signaling that runs throughout the negative reviews here is clearly coming from a blinders-on American perspective.  

Pedophilia...?  Get educated.  Pull up a map of ""Age of consent by country in Europe"" and your head will snap.  In most countries there, it's *14*.  _Most_.  Meaning, more than half.

Not convincing you?  Okay...then look at it this way:  How many people do you know, self-included, that had sex in high school between 14-16 years old...?  Then stop and ask yourself, honestly, ""why is that?""  Honest answer?  Because ""human nature.""  Full stop.

Still not convinced?  Okay...let's get even more real.  What's the age of consent in Connecticut, where this film's make-believe location was?  Answer:  *16*.  In other words, even in the film the ""kid"" was fully within his rights to respond to the life guard.  The h.s. vice principal's reaction to the student-life guard relationship made *no* sense unless her friend the life guard had been a h.s. teacher...which she clearly was not.

Aside from that last, very odd (untruthful) vector of the film, and speaking more to its acting, in the film Bell's performance is compellingly honest and real, and at 32-33 years old while shooting this she is also at her peak for physical attractiveness as well.  I say that to ground the reader again in reality:  this kind of thing happens, very naturally, and it's called real life...and Truth...and, yes, Beauty.  And I love real life...and Truth, and Beauty...the 'good' and the 'bad.'  And so should you.

""The"" relationship in the film clearly couldn't work out in the long run, was ""wrong"" to some people's thinking because of the age difference, and thus a ""bad mistake"" that people (some) took offense to.  To those people, I have to ask, ""Are you really rating this film, or what you did and didn't get out of life...including appreciation & thankfulness for the 'good' and the 'bad'?""",5

I found it so ironic that the year Ms. Garcia graduated from Ridgefield High 1995 as that was the year I moved to  Ridgefield: not far from town or the High School: I can easily see the characters in that area. It the old lets drop out of life and act as 18 again but truth is you can never go back.

I pulled sort my own crisis at 34 and left NYC to move to my weekend home in Ridgefield, CT (town is mentioned in movie when they're sitting around  but filmed in PA). As with the kids hanging out I saw them all the time aimlessly hang around the gas station Drunk or stoned.  Gee I used to hold up the drugstore wall with my shoulder & foot: swore if moved the building would fall.

"1511",288,"Great watch, will eventually watch again, and can recommend.

To be 100% honest here, your life might have to (have been) falling apart to really relate to this movie, and there is a potential ick factor of a character of double the age of the other in a relationship. Just go into the fictional story that includes people that don't exist with an open mind, then judge: I totally understand if it makes you upset, the movie even comments on it.

I'm a big fan of Kristen Bell, and sure she looks good, but the movie actually has a lot of nuance to it. The beginning of the movie has her covering this story about a Tiger raised in a New York apartment which becomes this underlying metaphor of her losing a ""man against the world"" type of scenario, which everyone should be able to relate.

As our ""every man"" Leigh goes to ground from being overwhelmed by the world (and let's be clear, she put her self there) to her parents and attempts to re-live being young (in high school) when she didn't have worries or responsibilities.

The movie is a wonderful balancing act of Leigh dealing with authoritarian problems and looking for happiness, showing how that struggle happens in the young, the ""middle"", the old.

The problem with acting younger in a rebellious age, is that you challenge or ignore your constructs of authority to attempt to establish dominance through benefit over your adversaries (in this case: society / the world) and your moral compass doesn't factor into that much.

Without giving actual spoilers, this movie captures these struggles of the every man, the every kid, the every parent, and they really deliver it in a wonderful way.

And sure, its not being kidnapped and tortured, or starving, the movie even points out a certain amount of privilege, but its still real, and its likely a more common ""struggle"" because everyone tries to find their way in the world.",4

But watching it as a more grown adult, I can't help but just keep thinking about how gross this movie is while watching it!

Let us call this scenario the 'female power fantasy', and note that it is brought to life once again in this movie.
The male power fantasy is basically to be the hero and save the day, as production is expected out of men.  If the concept of a female power fantasy interests you then here is an excellent video about this topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5KlGljHT8g? .",2

"1522",299,"The dystopian future setting has proved to be fertile ground in the past, and Gilliam practically built his post-Python career there, devising tragicomic scenarios that dabble in philosophy. In The Zero Theorem, the legendary Brit certainly draws on his formiddable powers of worldbuilding, particularly in his integration of bright and substantial practical set pieces (even for use in relatively short scenes), and discusses a classic theme - the meaning of life - through his own distinct lens. Despite recruiting A-list talent to convey the substance, the narrative feels tired and unsubstantial in its lamentations regarding the lack of a greater mortal significance and the retreat into short-term escapes. However, if nothing else, the film is at least a departure from the style of other, thematically similar films retaining the tragic elements but applying a thick coat of satirical and comic garnish in the design. (2.5/5)",3
"1523",300,"I really thought I would like this movie. I think the best way to describe this would be . Convoluted with not a big enough reward 2.1",2
"1524",301,"Nice acting, interesting world(it remember me Brasil) but the story is confusing and inconclusive.",2
"1525",302,"The Zero Theorem saw Terry Gilliam return to science fiction for the first time since 12 Monkeys in 1995. Unlike 12 Monkeys, it was met with mixed reviews; Gilliam later noted that only one professional reviewer realised that the film is a tragedy, not a comedy. I find that surprising, but then hindsight is a wonderful thing: once you know what Gilliam was trying to achieve however, the film's purpose becomes much clearer.
The screenplay by Pat Rushin tells the story of Christoph Waltz's reclusive computer programmer Qohen Leth as he is assigned to solve the titular Zero Theorem, which he is told will reveal the meaning of existence. Leth is very much a tragic figure: lonely, depressive and delusional, he is socially inept, suffers from anhedonia and has a disconcerting habit of referring to himself in the third person. Over the course of the film, he seems to find love in the eccentric form of Bainsley, but she turns out to be a stripper paid by the hour to lift his spirits. The crowning tragedy of the film comes when he realises with horror that the Zero Theorem will reveal that life is meaningless by proving that the universe will end with the Big Crunch. Leth's boss the Management – who employed Leth to solve the theorem because he hopes to profit from the chaos that it represents – sums up the film's central message when he explains that because Leth had faith that the phone call he has been waiting for will reveal the meaning of his life, he has spent a meaningless life waiting for that phone call.
The problem with The Zero Theorem is perhaps that Gilliam's style swamps Rushin's intention. It shares the aesthetic characteristic of Gilliam: the future city in which Leth lives looks like a hybrid of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The mise-en-scène blends the Bucharest location filming with cartoonish sets, a blend of the futuristic and the archaic reminiscent of Brazil (Leth lives in an old church), brightly coloured and often weird props, grotesque characters such as the clones, and outlandish costumes. Leth's disability hearing involves him lying on a couch in his underwear whilst three sinister looking doctors first address him from behind a desk and then prod and poke at him with latex-gloved fingers. Typically for Gilliam, the cameras are in constant motion, and there is an emphasis on physical and visual stimuli rendered partly as slapstick, thus for example when Leth is choking on an olive, only for him to expel it and for it to be subsequently snatched up by a mouse. For fans of Gilliam's work (and I am one) this surreal approach is all part of the fun, but it does make it easy to understand why some critics mistook the film for a comedy with no jokes.
But if Gilliam's indulgence works against him on this occasion, he still gets fine work from his cast members. Christoph Waltz injects real heart into the character of Leth, making him a figure of sympathy: this is not generally a film that lends itself to naturalistic performances, but Waltz manages to be believable in the role whilst still providing the theatricality that the film demands. The same is true of Mélanie Thierry, who plays Bainsley as an extrovert seductress/femme fatale, until her final scene with Leth when she suddenly exhibits emotion that seems genuine. Matt Damon's deadpan Management also works well, his insistence that he is neither God nor the Devil but just a man grounding the film in reality just in time for the enigmatic finale to leave it firmly behind. In the acting stakes, only an almost unrecognisable Tilda Swinton disappoints with an over-the-top turn as Dr Shrink-ROM. 
Gilliam fans can expect certain stylistic traits from his work: most of those are present in The Zero Theorem, but on this occasion they perhaps detract from the story his film is trying to tell. But if you can see past the colourful, eccentric trappings and deduce what he's trying to say, the message is suitably thought-provoking.",4

Remind yourself, if you please, of an episode of Saturday Night Live where the spoof's grab video ends, ""You are going to hell.""

Artful blend of Generation X multimedia cultural conditioning, this film has zest all the way down to certain deconstruction of 'That 70s Show'.

Not much a drop was wasted of scathing rip after scathing rip of retro indecency come back to haunt the living with all the living terror of hellfire eternal.

Sure, you can live live over again the same way twice. But taking all those jabs from 1990s film fare should had taught you a thing or two by now. And if ever there was someone who took a deep stab into the problem of youth angst, I think this comedy duo would had been somewhere in the shadows on the spot with a couple active lenses, taking in the strew at full effect.

Oh, it's not 5-star fare, but I'm rating this as a B movie. It's got quite a hefty lot of flair both for masochist and hedonist alike.

Never underestimate human nature. The chemistry in this film seems to be well-studied and unafraid of achieving a service to the viewer who gets the most straightforward of messages right perfectly, the first time through.

So, what's the grab here? It's not crap, and it belongs to a generation of film that you'll rarely see these days where the production crew has somehow got talent. Oh, there's nothing so obvious as a stamp that officiates the culture within a culture that this assembly of personalities represents. But then, the film clearly doesn't need one to succeed.

You can't judge a book by its cover nor by its ways. I think you'll be amazed at how simple it can be to follow the program and seriously entertain what to do when faced with such obvious conclusion that when you watch this film, where it shall be taking you.

I feel like something went wrong during the production, and she had to somehow make things seem watchable. It starts out solid, but it loses its control afterwards and it got very confusing. It's an underwhelming film.",3
"1573",350,"Touchy Feely, the latest from writer-director Lynn Shelton, is the dreariest thing this side of Shelton's hometown of Seattle. If the over-under on smiles cracked by the film's quartet of main characters was four, I'd take the under. Even worse than the misery is the film's thematic aimlessness. Shelton got at deep and meaningful human truths with Humpday (and tried to with Your Sister's Sister). Here, she's got all the symbolism in the world at her fingertips (pun intended), but it's in service of a pretty pedestrian story and underwhelming characters.

Abby (Rosemary DeWitt) is a seemingly happy massage therapist and her family's rock. Her painfully shy and awkward brother, Paul (Josh Pais), is seeing his dental practice disintegrate before his eyes, while his daughter-Abby's niece, Jenny (Ellen Page)-feels trapped by her father. She wants to go to college, but he doesn't make her feel like it's an option.

Very suddenly and bizarrely, Abby is stricken with a crippling inability to touch anyone, rendering her unable to work or be around her boyfriend, Jesse (Scoot McNairy). Meanwhile, her brother, too, undergoes an inexplicable change. He's curing patients of their pain, which brings in some new blood and helps turn the business around.

It's hard to figure what's worse-the film's setup or its conclusion. No explanation is given for either Abby's or Paul's sudden change in, what, cosmic energy? Both spend time with a hippie natural healer, Bronwyn (Allison Janney), but her presence is the film is as inexplicable as anything else. Still, an inexplicable plot turn-if it leads to compelling conflict and/or a satisfying ending-is totally fine. Touchy Feely has neither of these, sadly. The conflict is utterly nonexistent, so by the film's end, there's nothing to resolve.

Touchy Feely is not without merits. I'll never dislike Rosemary DeWitt in a movie. Ever. It's simply not in my genetic code. She brings an authenticity to even the most awkward of roles that casting her in your movie is an automatic win. I'd almost say the opposite of Ellen Page in most situations. Post-Juno, she never seems to fit the roles she's given, whether she's playing a genius architect in Inception or a hot, young sexpot in To Rome with Love. Here, she's hardly around enough to bring the picture down, but I'd argue against my better judgment that she actually brings something to the movie by remaining lower than low-key throughout.

Josh Pais is rather one-note as Paul, but the blame for this character's shortcomings and the film in general lies squarely with Shelton. She takes such visual liberties with her film's themes-throwing in a number of gorgeous extreme close-ups of skin and hands and all the things we touch-but when it comes to applying these themes to tell a story, she comes up startlingly short. Touchy Feely has a beginning and a middle (which aren't exactly good), but I'm sitting here, hours later, wondering what happened to the end, wondering how these characters have changed and learned. And I've got nothing, which is ultimately what this film amounts to.

"1576",353,"""Due to some unforeseen circumstances I will not be seeing clients for the time being.""

I was a huge admirer of Lynn Shelton's film, Your Sister's Sister, and I even included it on my list of the best movies of 2011 so I was eagerly anticipating what she would do next. I loved the way she captured those characters in such an authentic way and I was onboard for her mumblecore experimentation once again. Knowing that Rosemarie DeWitt was going to be back for the lead role was one of the main reasons I included Touchy Feely in my most anticipated movies of the year list. It didn't hurt either that Ellen Page was going to play a supporting role since I was a huge fan of her work in Hard Candy and Juno. Everything about Touchy Feely had my expectations high rocketed to the sky, but then 2012 came and poor word of mouth lowered my expectations to such a degree that I never ended up seeing it until now. It was a major letdown and it made Lynn's previous film, Laggies, seem like a masterpiece next to this. This is a dramedy that feels completely uneven and the plot doesn't seem to go anywhere. I didn't like any of the characters here and their motivations were hard to understand at times. The film was a mess and the pacing was so slow that this 90 minute film felt like it was three hours long. For a film trying to explore the interrelationships between these characters there was nothing to be said or discovered. Even the actors seemed to be lost and not fully understanding what their characters motivations really were. 

Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt), a successful message therapist, and her boyfriend Jesse (Scoot McNairy) are enjoying a lovely dinner at her brother Paul's (Josh Pais) home. Paul, emotionally distant and a bit depressed, lives with his daughter Jenny (Ellen Page) who has sacrificed her personal dreams to assist her father at his dental practice, which isn't exactly flourishing. Abby on the other hand is sought after for her great hands and seems to be going through a good moment in her life. She recommends his brother visit her Reiki instructor, Bronwyn (Allison Janney), who has done amazing things for her. Things take an unexpected turn in the family dynamics however when Abby suddenly develops a strange aversion towards skin which affects her work life. After Paul helps one of his patients recover from a terrible tooth pain, his dental practice begins to flourish due to the positive word of mouth his ""healing hands"" are receiving. While his relationship with his daughter seems to be getting stronger, Abbie's new aversion to skin affects her relationship with Jesse.

Despite the pretty original premise the film fails to explore Abby's problem. It's just a technique used to shake the interpersonal relationship in the family, but there is nothing that Lynn is trying to explore with her new found aversion. I really didn't understand why her character didn't simply explain to Jesse what she was going through because I'm sure he would've understood. He seemed like a pretty comprehensive type of guy. The introduction of Ron Livingston's character only feels like a filler and doesn't do anything to build the story. Ellen Page delivers a solid performance once again, but her character is trapped inside her emotional wall which doesn't allow her to fully blossom. Pais and DeWitt are the true stars of the film and their performances are the highlight of this forgettable film. Pais especially captures the eccentricities of his character in a rather natural way. I found the New Age mysticism in the film a bit too preachy and the indie quirkiness a bit too familiar. The tone of the film just dragged it down for me and I had a hard time relating to the characters or caring for any of them.

"1616",393,"The romantic comedy ""Baggage Claim"" (PG-13, 1:36) is the entertaining story of a single 30-something woman looking for Mr. Right and dealing with serious pressure from her family to find him - right now.

Montana Moore (Paula Patton) is a flight attendant who wants to settle down, but her search for a husband has been impeded by the demands of her job, her high standards, and the occasional two-timing boyfriend. When Montana's younger sister announces her engagement, Mo feels the pressure, especially from her mother (Jenifer Lewis). Mo's well-meaning co-workers and friends (Jill Scott and Adam Brody) hatch a plan to use their airport contacts to let Montana know when one of her old boyfriends is flying somewhere (since ""everyone flies during the holidays"") and get Mo on the flight for a not-so-chance encounter. After all, one of her exes may have blossomed into the man she's looking for.

Mo has 30-days to find a great date -slash- potential mate to take to her sister's rehearsal dinner - to satisfy her own goals, and to get her mother off her back. Mo's 30,000 mile odyssey leads her to encounters with former suitors played by, among others, Taye Diggs, Boris Kodjoe, Trey Songz and past Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou. All the while, Mo's childhood friend (Derek Luke), who lives in the apartment across the hall, is there to encourage Mo and just be a friend when she needs one.

The story's path may be predictable, but the journey is still pretty enjoyable. The major characters are charming and funny - especially Mo (although Patton does have a tendency to overact at times).

Brie Larson is just reduced to a always-on-her-phone-not-caring-about-us sister who I was wondering for the most part of the runtime I was waiting to speak. It also pokes fun at the Church for letting him loose so easily for his 'sins'. That part was funny. I recommend this movie to everyone, especially those addicted to adult entertainment who wants to know the other side.",4
"1629",406,"Without saying a word for most of the movie, Brie Larson steals every scene she's in. Very good movie as well. JGL is a real talent. And, this is no fluke. Watch Mr. Corman.",4
"1630",407,"I guess i missed on allot of JGL movies till this past year, but he's put out some really classic ones that I'm only starting to watch like Don Jon. Tackles a pretty tough topic head on and it really works. Being a Jersey guy myself, I had to laugh at some of the scenes. Every time he gets pissed off while driving kinda reminded me of my younger days -(owning a sports car and getting behind slow arse drivers). Laugh my ass off every time he's behind the wheel.  Had the same click of friends, hitting the clubs. Working out. Though the topic of J-off never came up. But than again, my single/dating days were mostly before the internet. So I could imagine what its like out in about now. I hated chicks like Johansson's character. Real hot chicks who try to change you and boss you around. Been down that road. Not sure if this is the movie for you single guys who are dating a new chick and this movie comes on. You might want to deal with that situation. Better off just jamming to some Marky Mark after a few cocktails.....",5
"1631",408,"Interesting take on porn and sexuality. JGH is fun with his Italian-American act. ScarJo gets a stereotypical character but looks hot as ever. This movie is a nice watch without breaking any new ground. It does try to spin around itself an air of new-age relationship-philosophy but works better as a simple dramedy.",4
"1632",409,"An unusual yet interesting film which demonstrated great comedic value whilst also portraying real-world issues relating to sex, porn, and romantic relationships.",5
"1633",410,"Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young Italian American and modern-day Don Juan living and working as a bartender in New Jersey, with a short list of things he cares about: ""my body, my pad, my ride, my family, my church, my boys, my girls, my porn."" Though he has a very active sex life, he is more sexually satisfied by viewing pornography and masturbating, which he claims allows him to ""lose himself."" On a night out with his two best friends, Bobby and Danny, Jon sees Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson), a young woman from a more affluent background. Although she finds him interesting, she declines his offer for a one-night stand. He finds her on Facebook and invites her to lunch. There is mutual attraction, but Barbara insists on a long-term courtship, which proceeds for over a month without sex. She encourages Jon to take night classes to get an office job outside the service industry, and Jon indulges her love for romance movies, which he usually dismisses as unrealistic fantasy. They meet each other's families and Jon's parents love her. The two have sex, but Jon is still dissatisfied. He loves Barbara and considers her body perfect, but still finds pornography more satisfying. While she sleeps, Jon watches pornography. Barbara catches him and is shocked. She prepares to leave Jon, but he denies that he watches pornography and claims it was a joke emailed to him by a friend.
Their relationship resumes, with Jon watching porn primarily outside his apartment, concealing his habit from Barbara. He is caught watching a video on his cell phone before a college class by Esther, a middle-aged woman Jon earlier encountered weeping by herself. Jon politely brushes her off. Barbara continues asserting control, insisting that cleaning his own apartment, a task Jon finds satisfying, is not something she is comfortable with him doing. Barbara checks the browser history on Jon's computer, confronts him with proof that he has continued viewing pornography, then ends their relationship...

Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus states: ""Don Jon proves to be an amiable directing debut for Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and a vivacious showcase for his co-star, Scarlett Johansson."" Don Jon received very positive reviews at the Sundance Film Festival. Entertainment Weekly managing editor Jess Cagle called the film ""one of the best movies I saw at the fest"" and wrote ""Funny, touching, smart, and supremely confident, Don Jon is also Gordon-Levitt's feature directorial debut, and it establishes him as one of Hollywood's most exciting new directors."" William Goss of Film.com praised Levitt for his ""assured style"" as both director and screenwriter. Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net gave high praise to the screenplay. Consensus of the film when it was played at the Sundance Film Festival, as noted by Odie Henderson, was that Don Jon was a ""more fun version"" of the 2011 film Shame. The supporting actresses Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore received praise for their performances. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice praised the film, writing: ""There's no dancing in Gordon-Levitt's writing-directing debut, Don Jon, although the movie is so heavily reminiscent—in the good way—of Saturday Night Fever that an arm-swinging paint-can reverie wouldn't be out of place.""

Joseph Gordon Levitt´s has written and directed this comment on pornography and the impact of it, perception of women and sex, love and relationships. There´s an essence for sure and a valid social political comment, but it´s not very intriguing as Don Jon himself is a douche and even in the end he still feels much like a douche and Scarlett Johansson´s Barbara is a douche as well. They are simply not likeable and you don´t cheer for any of them. I don´t have anything against Scarlett Johansson (she seems to be such a lovely person in real life), but she has never really managed to win me fully over in terms of her acting abilities. Don Jon´s understanding in the end of reality and fiction in terms of sex, love and relationships lacks of conviction to me. And Julianne Moore´s Esther emerges a bit from nowhere and it feels like an added character in the last minute to be the one who ""saves"" Jon from his narrowminded life. It feels forced. Nah, that´s not convincing to me at least. With this said, I obviously don´t agree to all the praise of this film. It´s ok, but nothing more.",3

But it is missing on every aspect. The premise of Trip is interesting. Actually, just following Trip would make an amazing movie. There is a crazy, interesting, meaningful story there. I want to watch that movie. Unfortunately that story never fully develops, and is too busy being interrupted by Metallica concert shots. But these shots were obviously done for the movie. I want two things: I want a full movie about Trip without Metallica in it at all and I want a full regular concert film of this tour because holy fuck that look like an awesome fucking show — see the Ride the Lightning chair and Tesla coils and shit? That's fucking amazing. I just want to see that. And then I want to see, in a totally different context, Trip setting himself on fire to protect this magical bag full of what I guess is Cliff Burton and defeating the bad guys.

"1658",435,"Johnny left a budding career in the music business after his first hit song to follow Jesus and become a church music director.  He now directs a worship band that includes his 18 year old daughter Grace.  Like many teenage girls, Grace is enamored by the popular music scene her father left behind.  Johnny knows how difficult life can be in the high stakes popular music scene and tries to keep Grace away from pursuing that path.  Grace is determined to go her own way.  Feeling stifled by her father, Grace takes a chance and moves to Los Angeles to pursue a career in popular music, offered to her by Johnny's old manager.

Grace achieves immediate success by covering her father's old hit song which has become popular again as the result of some Internet buzz.  She demonstrates enormous talent and the record company is ready to do everything needed to make her a star.  It doesn't take long for this naive teenager to get in over her head.  The stress and pressure of becoming a star begins to take its toll as she moves further and further away from God.  Fortunately, a Christian intern working at the record company, Quentin, befriends Grace and tries to nudge her back towards her relationship with God and her family.

In the end, Grace walks away from the popular music scene and goes back to singing Christian songs with her father.  Meanwhile, her friend Quentin has started a contemporary Christian music division at the record company and becomes the promoter for Grace and her father's new music.

I enjoyed watching this film.  The acting was good and the music was good.  The familiar tension between teenagers and parents is nothing new, but this story is actually about the tension between the world we live in and the path God wants us to take.  Overall, the details of the journey Grace takes in this film are a little too simplistic.  Things happen a little too fast and with not much time spent developing the kind of depth that could raise this concept to a higher level.  Still all the buttons are pushed and the emotions in these relationships ring true.  The likeable characters and quality acting performances makes this movie well-worth watching.",4

This is a Christian film and like usual, I did not mind that. I cherish film for what it narrates than on what it all was all built on. Yeah, there's a little annoyance when a father is not letting his daughter to pursue her dreams. Especially in this modern world, and too in the western world, this is a bit surprising.

Grace, an 18 year old girl raised with the Christian faith is set to find her own life path. Her father, who is insisting her not to abandon the faith is the one to be convinced about what she wanted to accomplish in her life. She takes the chance that comes her way and the rest is history making.

An inspiring film. Not just for the Christian faith, but anybody with dreaming to accomplish something big. Particularly the youngsters. The cast was good, and the characters. Music tracks too enjoyable. Maybe the runtime should have been a shorter to accompany the pace. But overall not bad, a fine film was once watching.

It is also a relief to see a rising star like Jamie Grace not only show a splendid acting talent, but also does not shamelessly throwing her in the spotlight in the film and letting the full talent of the movie show.

Tom Hanks is a tremendous actor, and Barkhad Abdi gives a very real portrayal of the desperation that comes with growing up with nothing, but the acting cannot come close to redeeming this film. The fact that the shooting of three Somalis is celebrated through the tone and score of the final segment is just an atrocious representation of where American perspectives stand. That this movie received the accolades and the score it has on this website says a lot about the mentality and lack of empathy felt by the average American for any story other than one of American hegemony.",2

The intelligence. The manipulation.  It depends on where you stand, but these people either draw you in or repel you. I would never have drank Jim Jones' CoolAid in the jungle.  Likewise, I couldnt spend an hour in the company of this megalomaniac. I don't know much about wikileaks but I understand the role it's played and how it has exposed both the guilty and the innocent in equal measure. It's a blunt instrument but an important one, I suppose. But important doesn't equate to interesting and this is one tedious film. Like Assange, it either draws you in or turns you off.

Schwarzenegger is fine here, but Stallone is looking a little too old (and pumped up) to play a spry action hero. On the bright side, Caviezel is sleekly evil, Jones has fun with his role and Ryan and D'Onofrio are both good, although underused.

Don't expect Fuller's subtle critique of contemporary America in this knuckle-dragging throwback style action flick. Instead, expect a pretty standard prison escape film (in space) that's overlong and takes itself way too seriously. Arnold looks like he's having fun and takes the right tone, but Sly seems to think he's going for an Oscar, which kind of ruins the fun. However despite its faults, the pairing of Stallone and Schwarzenegger really does go a long way, so if you enjoyed their cheesy action flicks of the 80s (i.e. ""Tango & Cash"" or ""Commando"") you'll likely enjoy this geriatric cheesy outing.

Secondly, the main character being kept in an off-the-grid prison on a boat despite the man in charge being aware that he's not a criminal/terrorist makes no sense. There was no motivation for getting rid of the main character and keeping him in prison. Then the main character managed to escape because the guards weren't watching the CCTV but cocked up climbing some pipes despite his experience. The fake CIA lady and Arnold's character being some big shot made for a laughible plot twist. The main characters not getting shot was also silly considering how many guards there were opening fire near the end. The stupidity goes on and on. The characters weren't believable at any point, and there were underdeveloped/pointless side characters.

The movie is just full of things that don't make sense, heck the whole premise of the movie is just stupid.  The US government would never pay 1.25 (or 2.5) million dollars to have someone break out of a prison once much less 7 times.  

I guess as I have grown older I have less tolerance for stupid movies like the D movies my dad used to rent in the 80's but at least those movies knew they were terrible and weren't pretending to be something better.  This movie, however, hurts my brain to watch.  It's cringe moment after cringe moment.  

I'm pretty sure this this isn't a SciFi or fantasy movie so you shouldn't be saying to yourself that's not how reality works every 30 seconds.  And the ""plot twists"" at the end is are just ridiculous and unnecessary.

"1726",503,"This is a review of  (2013), the 2013 remake adaptation of Stephen King's classic horror novel. It stars Chloe Grace Moretz as  White, a troubled teenager who discovers that she has telekinetic powers, while having to contend with an abusive mother and school bullies. The film also stars Julianne Moore as Margaret White, 's abusive mother and a religious fanatic; and Judy Greer played Miss Desjardin, 's supportive gym teacher. Directed by Kimberly Peirce, the film is competently shot and the acting is good, but it just seems superfluous at times and comes off as a retread of well-worn territory.

Regarding the acting, Chloe Grace Moretz was a perfectly fine  White, showing an apt level of vulnerability needed for the character and keeping that sense all throughout the film, even as she gains some more agency and confidence through her development of her powers. However, I have noticed (as have many others) that Moretz seemed a little too picture-perfect, a little too glamorously-portrayed to be regarded as a target ripe for bullying. It must be said that in real life, perfectly normal-looking people can and do get bullied, but in film, audience members usually expect some level of at least seeming unattractiveness from victims of bullying, while Moretz just seemed too attractive to be believable as someone being ostracized and bullied, even with her freak-out over her first period taken into consideration.Other than that, her performance was very good. Julianne Moore was a great deranged Margaret White, clearly having a fun time playing a disturbed religious fanatic. The actors and actresses who played the bullies weren't given much to do other than look attractive, act evil and condescending, and occasionally have doubts before doubling down on their vicious acts. The only exception is Sue, played by Gabriella Wilde, who regrets her part in the initial bullying and quickly tries to do her best to make amends to . She is shown as sympathetic yet helpless and rather ineffectual. Overall, the acting in the film was pretty good.

Regarding the plot, which hewed closely to the original novel, it concerns  discovering her telekinetic powers amidst a tragic coming-of-age story, being bullied by popular girls at school and suffering at the hands of an abusive and overbearing single mother who has obsessively religious beliefs. However, because of this, it doesn't really do anything new and aside from a setting update into the late 2000s/the early 2010s, there isn't much of anything original here, nothing the novel and its older adaptations haven't already covered.

Overall, the film was competently made, being well-shot and with good editing, good acting, but had some bad special effects and a tired plot that comes off as a complete retread without adding much to the story.

Score: 6/10",3

"1728",505,"Pretentious, with its constant attempt at philosophical, cryptic dialogue delivered in unnatural conversations. Pointless, like many of its scenes and subplots. Unrealistic, believe it or not.

"1731",508,"Rambling dialogue galore . Never knew cartel were so poetic and lawyers so caring . Every scene is a catch phrase . Bleccchhh",1
"1732",509,"This rough patch of Ridley Scott's esteemed filmography was definitely evident and nowhere is closer to the truth than this film. Written by author Cormac McCarthy of No Country for Old Men fame, the story and I use the term loosely, goes as follows. Michael Fassbender, simply known as the Counsellor. Is a lawyer for high profile members of the Cartel and he soon gets involved with cementing a drug deal that would be worth a great deal to those involved.

He is set up by his friend and client, Reiner played by Javier Bardem and financially ambitious girlfriend Malkina played by Cameron Diaz, Soon setting up the deal with business associate Westray played by Brad Pitt. After being warned of the potential danger involved, The Counselor is unconcerned and proceeds anyway. But, very soon, dangerous people are involved. Deceit and murder start to become afoot, and what starts out as a potential business deal goes horribly awry. The Counsellor will then have to defend himself as well as his fiance played by Penelope Cruz from sudden doom.

When you have a cast like that, with Ridley Scott behind the wheel and with Cormac McCarthy penning the dialogue, it sounds like a winning combination – alas no. This is one of the dullest, pretentious, and creatively inert films that I've ever seen. Cormac McCarthy's dialogue is one of the worst elements of this film. He is a talented author, but here it's like the Emperor has new clothes and also a script that was this film, as one big gift package. Every conversation in this film is written in the most pseudo-intellectual drivel that it's hard to take seriously. However, since the film relies on this spoken, exposition driven narrative, it becomes overly dull.

It doesn't help that Ridley Scott directs the cast to speak the dialogue in mostly hushed and serious tones, that really makes it seem complicated and forced. The film takes plenty of twists and turns and character arcs that overlap each other, which heavily remind you that films like Steven Soderbergh's Traffic or Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Amores Perros have done this narrative much better and with far more depth behind it all. Michael Fassbender is one of our most talented actors working today. He really does try to give the dialogue some credibility, but even he can't save this film from falling apart.

Not to mention that despite some sequences that are violent and out there. One scene, in particular, involves Cameron Diaz and a car. Which really defied belief and really should have been taken out the film altogether. It didn't further the story or really add anything; it was just gratuitous. On paper or as a simple pitch, there is something there that I'm sure would have seemed like a film to knock it right out of the park but as it is, it doesn't even reach first base. I think that this film, with all its intellectual dialogue and crisscrossing it, thinks it's deliberately meant to be vague and mysterious. Though it honestly just comes across as incomprehensible nonsense.

The cast themselves are talented in general. However, they deserve better material than what they were given. Ridley Scott really does need to find a better platform to showcase his necessary storytelling abilities – the future is bright.",1

"1766",543,"There’s a sad element to Last Vegas just based on the concept. It feels like a film where some veteran actors basically admit that they are past their prime, and are trying to cling to one last hurrah before the end. Yet, it’s not nearly as dismal as the plot or the reviews would suggest. The plot of four retirees going on a Hangover-like spree through Las Vegas is full of comedic potential. Filling the cast with legendary actors doesn’t hurt either. Sadly, they don’t quite hit the mark, and this movie falls short of doing anything great. It has at least four scattershot stories going on at once, because each lead actor needs his own subplot. Some are more interesting than others, and the movie does fall into a lot of clichés. If you are surprised by anything that happens in this movie, you clearly don’t have much experience with films, because these plots are all from Screenwriting 101. Yet, despite all its shortcomings, I did find myself chuckling a few times. Even more impressive than the occasional laugh, I was actually moved in an emotional way by Last Vegas. I saw every beat of the main emotional arc coming, but it affected me enough to make me sympathize with the characters. I wasn’t to the point of shedding any tears, but it was impactful to some degree. I think a lot of that is because even lackluster material can have some gravitas when given to De Niro and Douglas. The entire film could have used a bit more structure, though. There are a lot of little things that happen in Last Vegas and I often wondered why they were included in the film, because they didn’t impact the rest of the story. Perhaps they were failed attempts at jokes, but I certainly wasn’t laughing. That being said, I’ve definitely seen worse films in this genre. At least the characters in Last Vegas are likable and engaging, and the actors are still trying (despite the fact that the film seems to be telling them they are past their prime.) ",3

Never has a movie been so disappointing. The screenplay was bad, the acting was like watching dinner theater, the artistic liberties taken with the original story made the story worse.

He plays the general manager of the Cleveland Browns, with the whole film set over the course of Draft Day, as he desperately tries to secure himself draft picks by pulling in favours, offering deals of his own, and generally getting stressed. He has good support from Jennifer Garner and the late Chadwick Boseman, and although it follows the textbook to the letter, it's thoroughly enjoyable fodder, the right film at the right time.",3

He needs to make a HUGE splash not only for the betterment of his franchise but for the security of his position. Sonny is left with a crucial decision, go for the gusto and draft the big name QB whose playing ability is celebrated everywhere he's been but has a high chance to bust or go back to the basics and draft the lower ranked linebacker with a muddled past but a pure love for the game that could be the framework of a well rounded powerhouse. To leave his current QB as an afterthought or to build off of the surprisingly solid culture the team already possesses. Sonny has always been backed into a corner of which the successful reputation his father garnered before him but now the choice is his and solely his despite the detesting nature of the owner and loud polarizing coach. Moves will be made and relationships tested to the max on Draft Day!
I'll be 100% honest about this film, if you're not a football you won't like this clearly. Any Kevin Costner fan will be all for this one as he really is at his best in this film just proving that the man can excel no matter the plot or subject matter he just too good in my opinion.",4

"1809",22,"Very Disappointed
I love the horror genre, and I will tolerate a bad horror film to see new concepts, new monsters, new paranormal threats, or new horrific themes in the genre. To me, even bad horror movies have something to add to the genre and are worth watching. When I saw the previews for this movie, I was immediately interested. It looked original. It wasn't a monster movie, it wasn't a psycho murdered movie, and it wasn't your average ghost story. After watching, I must say I was pretty disappointed with the lack of innovation.

The first half of the movie is more or less an introduction, laying the groundwork to the story, the background, the characters, etc. and I must say this part was done quite well, and it was very intriguing. As the explanation unraveled I was eager for the adventure to begin because the story setup was excellent and leaves the audience primed for a good story. The last half of the film is the bulk of the ""horror"" part, however there is a strange element of time in this film which made it kind of hard to follow, and the film doesn't display a consistent timeline. Often I was left confused as to exactly if the characters were in the present, reliving old memories as their old selves, or if what we were seeing was just a flashback. Usually if a story has a lot of time changing (going back and forth through time in flashbacks), what happens in the present is mostly, somehow, explained in the story when it switches back to the present, but what happens in this film is that once the flashbacks begin to take over the story, there is almost no explanation of what is happening in the present. The story will flash back to the present and leave the audience wondering what's going on, or what happened in the interim, or why this character is doing this, or why that character is doing that.

The film could have also been so much better if there was perhaps a ""tell"" of some sort when what the characters were experiencing was a paranormal event or not. The film makes many references to illusions or hypnotic states as a plot driver, but at some points it is so diluted even you as the audience member are wondering, wait is what's happening here, really happening, or are the characters just imagining it happening? There is no way to tell, and the film does nothing to explain it. You are just left wondering, and that to me is a weak storyline, leaving it up to the audience to decide.

In all, it started off promising and ended quite ridiculously, with none of the phenomena really explained at all, and the characters more or less completely failed at every objective. Not to say that a story MUST have a happy ending in order to be a good film, but it must have some sort of resolution, even if the ending is not always a good one for the characters themselves. This story failed to grasp the really interesting parts- the paranormal phenomena surrounding the circumstances, the two lead characters having opposing ideas about what had happened, and how what happened in the past is explained (or in this film, not explained.) Basically it's a bad horror movie, not a 100% waste of time, but certainly not a memorable film, and not one that leaves you thinking about it afterward, except to wonder about how very little of it seemed to make any sort of sense.",3
"1810",23,"While it's modern theme of a horror movie tempt you to not have hope for a good scare- I was surprised by the effects and the flash backs that gave it a really interesting twist into how I felt about it.

It is gripping and the viewer will keep wondering what is real and what is not.

Asians are still not considered top talent or have very many lead roles in the television and film industry, slowly we are trying to make our way into hollywood.

Watching this film felt like all the efforts of racial equality fell three steps back I can't help but be disappointed in the girls that took on the roles in this movie. Films shot on a low budget can still have a chance to be great, but this film went downhill the second I pressed play. The casting, costumes, basically everything felt like a bad youtube video. The nudity in this movie was displayed very tastelessly, like amature soft porn. And the bloody scenes consisted of bad cgi and ketchup.

All it does is further exploit the characters/actresses by having them go under cover as strippers all whilst still in school!

Samantha Morton is outstanding as Annie, she portrays the character to perfection and takes you on a journey - great performance. Aaron Paul is very good too, as he plays the role of Paul. The rest of the cast are solid.

This production is pretty straightforward, not that that's a negative as it prioritises storytelling and allows the actors to act. It was also the right call to make the run time 91 minutes, any longer then it would've dragged.

My only criticism would be that the two onscreen narratives never join up, I was waiting for the vast majority for them to collide but they never do; barring one conversation. I guess it's sticking to realism, though.

"1920",133,"Half movie, half documentary, the story of most crucial scientific discovery.

The film was inspired by the real life stories of the two women from the same timeline who had no connections, except theirs involvement with something. That means there are two sets of stories that's told one after another in parts which covered the events from nearly the three decades. So it all begins in the 1960, where two little sisters promise to each other about something, but 10 years later one of their's life changed forever when another one dies of cancer. So this is the story where the other sister begins her fight against the disease that took her family away.

This is a small budget film that shot entirely within a month of time. There are lots of actresses in this, even for the small roles. I thought Helen Hunt would lead the narration, but then there were Maggie Grace, Alice Eve, Aaron Paul and others. Great dedications by all, but this was Samantha Morton's film.

I did not know what this story is about when I decided to watch, but I'm pretty happy for the film. Except the material was more a documentary suitable kind, especially the story of Helen Hunt's character. Moreover feels like it is a short film with a decent story. I think it is worth a watch because of unfolding an important scientific discovery of our time. So a big yes on that perspective, but entertainment wise it is just an average. Now you can decide this on what you're seeking.

"1922",135,"Review:
This movie really did touch me, because a couple of my family members have recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. The emotional strain that this terrible disease puts on a family, was shown in this movie and I must admit, it did bring a tear to my eye. The fact that they haven't found a cure for this disease, is extremely worrying for everybody in day to day life, so when Mary-Claire King found a connection through the family gene it was truly an amazing thing. More and more people are testing for the disease, especially if it's in there family, so this movie brought to light how certain cancers are passed through our siblings, genetically. The performance from Samantha Morton is excellent, especially when she was going through chemo the second time and the technical side of Mary-Claire's work is easy to understand and interesting to follow. It did seem like the film was made for TV, mainly because I have seen a lot of movies that cover this subject matter on TV but it's still an emotional drama which I thoroughly enjoyed. I will warn you to have a box of tissues next to you when you watch this film because it's an touching rollercoaster that a lot of people can relate to. Enjoyable!

Round-Up:
This is the first movie written and directed by Steven Bernstein, who done a great job by bringing a medical milestone to light. It didn't get the big distribution treatment like a lot of uninteresting movies that I have seen lately, which is a shame because the subject matter is becoming more popular to households across the world. I must admit, you do have to be in the right frame of mind before you watch this film because it does touch many issues which can be a bit too Â emotional for people who are suffering with cancer. With that aside, it's still worth a watch, just to see what Marie-Claire had to go through to bring her findings to light.

I recommend this movie to people who are into their dramatic movies starring Rashida Jones, Aaron Paul, Helen Hunt, Samantha Morten, Alice Eve, Maggie Grace, Corey Stoll and Ben McKenzie. 6/10",3
"1923",136,"This was a great movie based on a true story about a family of women affected by breast cancer. 
Despite the sad and serious subject, there was humor in this and I really enjoyed it being set over the 60's - 80's. Annie was really brace and relatable. 
I'm surprised the rating on this is relatively low. Okay, it's not exactly a feel good movie to watch over and over, but it really was well done and the cast were all excellent. 
I liked her sister, and the (dumbass) wannabe rockstar husband was amusing (up until the point he was too much of a douchebag).  Helen Hunt doesn't play a huge role, important to the story, but she's not the lead actress here.",5

At the time it came out, in 2014, I wouldn't have seen it, but 7 years later, on a bland ordinary evening at home in 2021, having it pop up on Netflix, I watched with super low expectations and enjoyed the hell out of it. It was at times truly hilarious. I hate the expressions Laugh Out Loud Funny...but it is. I can't believe critics said it was misogynist -- they didn't get it. The story is this: a woman who's a pleasant chipper flawless newscaster is in a rut in her personal and professional life, and up for a promotion at a bigger news station, doesn't get the job AND gets dumped by her boyfriend in one evening, sending her into a tailspin--her 2 partier friends convince her to go out and get trashed in an uncharacteristically skimpy outfit one of them lends her, she ends up going home with a cool artist guy, gets locked out of his loft, and has to somehow get home. Hijinx ensue. I love variations of the ""Odyssey"" narrative, because we all want to find our way back home, one way or another, whatever that means---and this one is witty, litely political, bold in terms of claiming who you are internally rather than externally, and about love, friendship, and pretty damned funny slapstick, pratfall, and misunderstanding-based humor.

"1937",150,"There were quite a few good little moments of both action and tension, as well as genuine nods to the original  fans, but this is, ultimately, a somewhat terrible movie.  The main reason for this is that the movie has a large number of characters, and EVERY ONE of them takes extended turns playing the comic relief character, resulting in a movie with massively jarring jumps in tone.  This is a shame, as this movie has several slow-burn moments of tension, and these are genuinely good, and while the  CGI itself is uneven, the animation is solid, as is the CGI of NYC itself (and its destruction).  And while it feels completely opposite of what we want as  fans, the moments of  running away from Military helicopters is quite a thrilling ride, or at least it was in 1998 on the big screen.  But the movie has aged rather poorly from a technical perspective, and combined with a sloppy and overly-quick climax with the main  monster itself, there's just nothing left to recommend this movie for.  It's not particularly well Written or well Directed, the acting is acceptable and even the better CGI looks standard-issue today.  Honestly, I'd just skip it.",2

I figured that maybe I was just nostalgic for being a kid, but earlier today the soundtrack came up on youtube, so I listened to it, and it brought back a lot of old memories, so I watched it again, if, for no other reason, than to confirm the movies terribleness.

There are other pleasant performances though, Pitobash Tripathy (Amit) stands out most from those behind Hamm. Bill Paxton (Tom), Lake Bell (Brenda), Suraj Sharma (Rinku) and Madhur Mittal (Dinesh) merit props too.

It's a feel-good premise, one that is rather nice to see play out. The score is solid, as is the cinematography. It's a positive that they spend a decent chunk of the film actually in India, I had a inkling they might've skipped it but thankfully they do not - they tell the story well.

In fact no one in the cast is anything near outstanding, and some far from it. Except Elle Fanning as Princess Aurora and Brenton Thwaites as her prince, it's symptomatic that the best acting performance is done by an animated raven, or was it one of the tree monsters, that look like they are taken directly from Lord of the Rings, or was it Guardians of the Galaxy? Particularly during the firts section of the film the dialogue and story progress is sometimes so slow that one might question whether the director has been totally spellbound by the task and forgot to give directions, or if he's been present at all. Yes, the Jolie witch and tree monsters may be spooky in the right lightning, but there seems to have ruled a general angst of scaring some of the younger children, so the total suffers from appearing as something close to a kids stage production full of extras, which never works well on film.

It has great effects; I will give it that. But, where the film fails is in its character-arc. Rather than display 's gradual transition, the film spends a max of 4 minutes, where Jolie goes from a weepy girl having lost her wings, to a woman limping in frustration, to an villainous queen seated on a thrown of her own making (and with a pair of body guards lookin like undead versions of Groot). This is not character development.

And, there is also very little to be said for the man she loves, who ultimately becomes the rival King. His portrayal falls flat, but I'd can hardly blame.

Then when they arrive in this town, it's stuck in the 80's. No cell service makes him ditch the technology and lost luggage leads him to wear clothes found in a dresser. Then this modern kid experiences all the clichés of an 80's summer movie. Without that kind of twist, it's just all the clichés of a summer movie for no reason. 

Plus it still bothers me that he likes ping pong so much that he travels with his own paddle, but he is so bad at it that he can't score one point against the bully in the first match?

I thought the musical numbers were great, and the drama of how Frankie Valli and his band members worked together to overcome all the inter-personal conflicts and end up becoming one of the most successful American pop-rock bands was very moving.  I recommend this film for fans of the 4 Seasons!   Many of the well-known 4 Seasons' hits are sung or played (""Sherry,"" ""My Eyes Adored You,""  ""Walk like a Man,""  ""Oh What a Night"").",4

The movie fails to correctly set up all the characters so by the end you don't really feel much of a connection to the bland folks you just spent the last two hours with. On the positive side I think John (the lead) is a standout , he does the best with what he's given and at times delivers really great moments towards the end. The movie is a fine time waster but sadly it had so much potential to be awesome. If it had a script that was more focused and spent better time introducing the side characters (and frankly the main characters too) then the movie would have soared.",3

"2087",300,"Strengths: One of the things that made the first installment work way better than I ever expected was the chemistry among the cast. That remains a strong aspect this go around. Everyone mostly plays well off each other, leading to some scenes that work better than expected. The scenes at the strip club and in jail are two of the highlights, as well as the antics that Cedric Ward (Kevin Hart) get into throughout the evening. I must commend the addition of Wendi McLendon-Covey (Tish) as she was quite funny in her time on screen. The mid-film ""Poison"" music video was also a treat.

Weaknesses: As well as the cast worked together, a lot of the writing fails them. Each couple is given a subplot to work with, but most fall flat. Dominic (Michael Ealy) and Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) probably have the most interesting, but even that isn't great. Candace (Regina Hall) and Michael (Terrence J) have a plot that hits familiar beats from part one, while everything with Loreta (Jenifer Lewis) is a drag. Kirsten (Gabrielle Union) and Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) have a plot about trying for a kid that is unoriginal, while Zeke (Romany Malco) and Mya (Meagan Good) are a far cry from the scene stealers they were in the original. The subplots all feel very lazy.

Overall: As funny as Kevin Hart is, there was too much of him in this. I get that he's the biggest name, but too much focus there made the rest of the film an afterthought. That wasn't helped by lazy writing and all too familiar tropes. Still, there are enough laughs and chemistry between the talented cast to make it worth checking out.",3

Never ever planning on seeing Movie 43. You know what they all have in common? They all suck.  is a basketball feel-good movie. I usually enjoy basketball movies even when they are bashed by critics. That's probably because I am a big basketball guy and I even play basketball. This one is just stupid and only has a few laughs. It has that cliche when one of the main guy characters flirts with the main mom and hates him back. This movie had a few good characters like Martin Lawrence's character Coach Rick or something. That kid on the basketball team with the Allen Iverson hair is a cool character. The main mom is an alright character as well. The rest of the characters are just dumb.

"2112",325,"This is a very funny and specific movie that probably won't satisfy everyone.  The joke is that this film is a parody of rom-com tropes and they do a great job of unpacking the genre and providing all the beats of the films many of us grew up digesting, that probably also shaped our perceptions of how to behave within the context of romantic relationships. I gotta give the cast and crew props on being completely committed to the construct of the film, resisting the urge to get sentimental or to take the tropes and dissect them, make fun of them, but then also sort of fall back on them and rely upon to actually be a rom-com, as opposed to film making fun of rom-coms.  This is not a rom-com and I admire the filmmakers for just going for it.  

Ultimately this is an absurdist film much in the same realm as the old ""Airplane"" films or the ""Hot Shots"" films in which fantastical and fourth-wall breaking antics ensue that reveal that this is not meant in any way to be taken seriously.  For that reason, the movie was nostalgic, as there is a simultaneous mindless and memorable quality to those old films that I miss.  There are some pretty unique moments - one in which Paul Rudd goes back and forth with a bartender in kind of weird endlessly repeating loop, and another, much later in the film when Paul Rudd visits is grandmothers and shares one of the cringiest exchanges ever put to film.  Again, this movie is totally committed to its premise and isn't about to let up for one second.

Which again brings me to the thought that this one won't be for everybody.  I suppose if you liked the ""21 Jump Street"" movies or ""Magruber,"" you get a sense of what this one is like.  I really liked it, but didn't rank it higher only for the somewhat cheap production quality and because it isn't really emotionally satisfying in any way.

"2122",335,"(2.5 stars)
A documentary delving into the now known sins of the Catholic Church. Definitely informs us to a greater extent of the sinister details than 'Spotlight' and it adequately identifies the individuals in the church who participated in the outrageous cover-up. However I found the structure and presentation bland and it's focus on one paedophile priest in particular somewhat obscured the large scope of the scandal.",3

The agony of knowing what O'Grady and the likes of him did to children is shown in the faces and the words of those families whose lives have been torn apart by this horror.
This film, in my opinion, is far more powerful than the one that won accolades at the recent Oscars, because it talks directly to those involved. I will never forget Mr Jyongo and his pain on knowing what O'Grady did to his daughter.
The fact that O'Grady is a free man now, in Ireland, is nothing short of a national disgrace - for that country, for the Catholic Church, and for all of us who fail to speak out and support those fighting against abuse. As painful as it is to watch, everyone should see this film, and then go and do something.",5

Of course it has its moments of cgi and writing that's just :P, but they pass pretty fast. One critique I do have is the character development and just how they were shown as characters. Character traits, fears, etc. could've been slightly better or at least placed in different sections to be better, but nothing can be perfect so good job :). (SPOLIERS) I will say though the moments portraying Munch during and right before he went into the truck was good. It was a nice reminder to the audience that hey, these are still 13 year old's who won't always know better. As well as adding some slight nice insight into his character as well :)

"2129",342,"Bad watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.

I remembered this being decent the first time I watched it, but that was a Vidcon, so maybe it was the hype.

This movie is an example of why people don't like found footage, just thrown together as if some stupid kid did it, and then there is active narration and editing from the camera person.  That in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing to have happen, but this one is.  Found footage should be found, this is more like first person account...or a fake-umentary.

Echo itself (it is not a ""he"") is cute enough but spends a lot of time hiding and there is a communication barrier, but only one way.  If it can connect to the smartphone, then it should be able to use the device as a speaker to express the language it understands from the kids.

Alot of the movie is just young boys being defiant and ""girls have cooties, but I like it"".  It fails as a ""coming of age"", it fails as a ""romance"", and it barely succeeds as sci-fi or ""evil secret organization"".

This had the potential to be the next ""E.T."", but they just made weird choices throughout the design.",2
"2130",343,"Yes its true what people are saying for once it has a similar ties to E.T, which was a better film by the way.

The story was great even though we seen it before, the kids are well acted and all the events that happen were be liable, A good kids movie with a good E.T look alike film. So for this being a good film that I really enjoyed until the end, and delivering some good solid scenes with the modern found footage camera, I give "" Earth To Echo "" a B-.",4

And women were portrayed in such a demeaning manner, it was sickening. It was just pure profanity and bad comedy. The only scene that was funny was Katt Williams' scene.

"2139",352,"School Dance is a 2014 American comedy-drama musical film directed, written, and produced by Nick Cannon (Host of America's Got Talent, Wild 'n Out, Chi-raq). The film stars Bobb'e J. Thompson (Role Models, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl), Kevin Hart (Think Like a Man, Ride Along), Mike Epps (Next Friday, The Hangover), Amber Rose, Affion Crockett ( Dance Flick, Pixels),Luenell (All About Steve, Think Like a Man), Kristina DeBarge ( Former American Idol Contestant, Televisions Growing Up Hip - Hop), Katt Williams (Norbit, First Sunday), George Lopez (Balls of Fury, Rio), and Wilmer Valderrama (That '70s Show, Larry Crowne) The film was released on July 2, 2014 in select theaters, V.O.D, and Digital HD. This is also Cannon's directorial feature film debut. This film has a remarkable cast of talent, and honestly this movie isn't that good. On the other hand, it's a guilty pleasure of so bad that it's good.

  I'm aware that maybe one or two (or more) brain cells are dying as I watch this. But I didn't mind, I actually watched the film in its entirety. This film is fueled by sex jokes, stereotypes revolving around black and Mexican-American lifestyles; This hip-hop-infused musical movie features a gallery of notable comedians. Nick Cannon may not be the best director or writer. However, damn he can gather the talent! (If you want to call them talent)

 Even though this film is loaded with stereotypes, sex jokes, and brain cell melting vulgarity. There is at least an element of sweetness to the film in our lead character Jason, played by Bobb'e J. Thompson, a low self-esteem and less than well-endowed virginal high school student who has a hopeless crush on his beautiful classmate Anastacia, played by Kristinia DeBarge, who barely knows he exists. His only hope to impress her is to join the school's hottest ""clique"" and help them win a hip-hop, ""Lock-In"" dance competition, which offers a $2,000 prize. 

 To be honest, a majority of the acting is so bad and over the top it's actually funny. Jason's mother, played by Luenell, is so outrageous, over -bearing, gun shooting, and loud you can't help but watch how much worse she or her character can get. Also, the pot-smoking principal, played by Mike Epps is so cartoonish it's hard to take him or anyone else in the movie seriously. 

 Cannon also infuses the proceedings with various stylistic devices, including onscreen graphics and freeze-frames, to mostly negligible effect. In addition, while Thompson and DeBarge are appealing, the veteran comic performers in the supporting cast are unable to rise above the cartoonish material. What makes films like Dope, Super bad and American Pie so memorable are at the end of the day we can relate to the characters. Another big issue I have with the film is a majority of the cast that's in high school don't look like high school students. Amber Rose is in high school? Seriously? (That's a nice high school).

 I know this movie is so bad that it's funny. Even though I don't think that's the intent. Nevertheless, it was so obvious, that the featuring endless scenes of leering shots of beautiful young women shaking their booties, and all the other goodies God gave them into the camera are only there to include the numerous music designed to provide the filmmaker the opportunity to contribute to the soundtrack.  The slow-motion erotic car-washing scene is not even that offensive to women, because the males in this movie are just as badly and equally portrayed if not worse. (Car wash scene...I'm not complaining). 

So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film School Dance. I know it's a bad movie, but I did have some fun even if it was for the wrong reason. At the end credits, I am indicating that the film was much more fun to make than to watch. At the end of the day, I'm glad I came across it. Even though I do not need to come across it again or any time soon. I'd love to see what Nick Cannon does next. I believe School Dance earns a...

"2155",368,"What a great film. It's disjointed, naturally, due to the very bizarre production and filming structure that was enforced. But that's the goal, isn't it? This was always designed to be a very weird film, a very artistic film, something very non-traditional.

And it excels. If you introduced this film to someone without any prompting or context, this would seem like a fairly simple film about a boy growing up and finding himself. But when you extrapolate the whole thing into what it actually is - an epic of age, growing up, and life, in both real and artistic time - it becomes something extremely unique and beautiful.

And through it all, it has some super interesting things to say. Lots of unique political commentary that seems oddly prescient for the 2020s. Lots of nostalgia, especially for someone like me who grew up at these ages, in Texas, during those times. And the fantastic acting from all the actors is superb.

It's so hard to actually figure out how to properly compliment this film. It was both way ahead of it's time, and still remains ahead of this time. How did this film even get made? What a fantastic piece of cinematic history, and what an inherently good story to be told, all woven of complexity and teenage and pre-teen angst. I can't only watch this one time.

"2160",373,"Richard Linklater defies conventional film making on a regular basis, and  is probably his most intriguing to date. Filmed in short segments over the space of twelve years with the same cast,  follows the journey of Mason, not necessarily through the traditionally key moments of someone's life, but flagging up the more cultural milestones; a midnight release of a Harry Potter book, the Iraq war for example. Anchored by inspired performances from Ethan Hawke (so brilliant in Linklater's Before trilogy) and Patricia Arquette (who won an Oscar for her portrayal of Mason's Mother)  is something truly original, and it was probably robbed of an Oscar by Birdman (2014) (despite the fact that I do quite like Birdman).",4
"2161",374,"I really enjoyed this movie! I was worried that the gimmick of filming the actors as they grow up would overpower the story, leaving it an afterthought, but I was very wrong. The story is told beautifully, with characters that weave in and out of each other's lives in a way that feels much more real than most drama films. The acting is alright, and it's easy to tell that the child actors get better as the movie goes on and they get older, but it's more endearing than anything. My favorite thing about this movie is how it's really a time capsule of millennial comings-of-age; I found myself connecting with memories I didn't even know I had, its nostalgia being emphasized by being set in the same time that it's filmed without the rose tinted glasses of looking to the past. The ending is satisfying and uplifting, and the whole thing never drags, despite its expansive runtime.  is a unique film on a lot of levels, but it's also just a straight up good movie.",5

I ended up watching it in installments of about 30-45 minutes each. It wasn't compelling enough to watch in a single sitting. In the distant future this movie may be valuable to historians interested in everyday life in American families in the early 21st century, but, for those of us who are still close to that time, it's dull.",3

"2173",386,"They had us in the first half, not going to lie. Though I was really happy with the direction this film immediately went for in creating a soft sort of post-apocalyptic world for humans and apes to get along in, I wasn't exactly sold on the approach that this film took. It was just under an hour of nobody trusting nobody, blunders being made and guns being waved and while it was certainly wrought with tension, it was the stressful, unpleasant sort of tension because both sides and all the stand out characters on both sides (except Carver, He was just an idiot) have such believable and pitiable motivations and social predicaments that the idea of conflict between them (something I knew was eventually going to come) seemed completely undesirable. With the plot moving so slowly at the beginning, it was slightly agonizing to experience. However, there was enough interesting character dynamics (Caesar and Malcom, Caesar's son's apprehensions, Koba's stirring hatred, Maurice with everyone but especially Malcom's son) and visually resplendent world building to keep the film going until Koba does the fateful deed. After that, the film blooms fully into it's singularly unique, compelling, tragic, chaotic and almost operatic identity. I think it was the only right decision the writers could have made to have the apes strike first. After the first film we have sort of been conditioned to see the humans as the enemies of the apes and what with the enormous arsenal and testy nerves of the human colony, it seemed that the oppression of the apes would soon come again. It was exactly the development the Caesar and the apes needed, a conflict, betrayal, a villain in their midst to drive home that the apes are not intrinsically better than the humans. The moment that Caesar realizes this, lying wounded in front of his son, brought low by the betrayal of his own kind and humbling himself by returning to the home he had moved on from is a powerful moment and what I think the entire film was leading up to. Caesar and Malcom both realizing the worth of the other's kind and acknowledging each other as friends. On a big picture scale, the apes trilogy is using it's second installment to level the playing field between apes and humans to set up the climax of the third act, but it does so in an explosive and poignant way. I think the flavor that this film has that most science fiction action films do not is a feeling of tragedy. Not tragedy in the sense of failure, but in the conflict and mistrust between and within the apes and humans that inevitably will lead to great strife. This film has action, drama and heart but each of these is given a vein of tragedy. Thankfully, it is the kind that is epic even in it's laments and drives some hard hitting questions home as the apes become smarter and stronger. Heck, not only do they talk a lot more, by the end they were speaking in metaphor while beating the snot out of each other. It may sound odd, but that kind of thing is what I think the apes movies are made for. Another significant advancement… have I mentioned that this movie is very good as a sequel? Paying homage, carrying themes over from the first installment while giving the narrative further believable direction and a wider focus? Well now I've mentioned it, and the greatest thing about it is the increased inclusion of the best character in the series: Maurice. Maurice already has the advantage of being an orangutan which is makes him cuddly and imposing at the same time, but he also gets the singular honor of being the good friend to the main characters and since not as much attention is given him, he is not tarnished by a lesson needing to be learned or a flaw to correct. He's just pure awesome. When he turns his piercing eyes toward Malcom's family and utters his one word in the film ""run"" I got chills. He's just a peaceful, understanding presence and he's the only one who gets along with both sides (something I wished could've happened for everyone) and when he had to, he grabbed that ape and showed him who's boss. I love that kind of character. I was genuinely concerned when he got shot but was relieved to see that he just shook it off like the bad-A he is. Such good stuff.",4

https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Kdyk5Us2yXzyt9gNNOPng?si=w-kR4dc0Sc6KhfkaQBGPVw",1
"2219",432,"What can you say about a bad comedy other than it’s not funny? Sex Tape is a movie entirely built on the premise of a couple that has decided to spice up their love life by recording themselves having sex, and then accidentally releasing that recording to others. For starters, the mental gymnastics they go through in order to explain how the video is spread is utterly moronic. It’s clear the writers were trying to figure out a plot device that would allow the “sex tape” to be released wide enough to make the couple nervous but not so wide that they can do nothing to contain it. So their solution is to invent a main character who is rich enough to hand out iPads like they are candy, and yet dumb enough to think syncing up his media library to all these devices makes sense. From the beginning this makes Jason Segal both annoying and dumb which is not a good combination in a protagonist. I suppose the stupid premise could be saved if the madcap journey to recover all the iPads had been funny. Poor logic is forgivable in a good comedy, but Sex Tape is about as far from a good comedy as you can get. Their “wacky” journey amounts to only 3 stops, and the best attempt at a joke they can muster is having a guy who presents himself as warm and kind, listening to heavy metal and snorting cocaine (while Jason Segel fights with a dog.) This isn’t even good enough to make me crack a smile. Most of the twists and turns in the film are predictable, and that also spoils any attempt at surprising you into a laugh. It’s sad because I actually like both Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz, and they seem like a good pair to star in a film as a comedic duo. But with a script as uninspiring as what they were given in Sex Tape, no one will ever be clamoring for them to try again. ",1
"2220",433,"Made for couples to share understandable laughter and then reluctantly look over the dimensional awkwardness, being the natural core, that still impacted the film's level to a pass under both meanings. When not inappropriate, it humbly matures and charismatically comedic chemistry improves to gain acceptance but still anchored down due to its unwelcoming, invasive topic by parodic timing. (C+)",3
"2221",434,"Such an empty film.

This is simply terrible. I didn't laugh at all, which is saying something coming from a guy who enjoys films like 'Kangaroo Jack', 'Thunderpants' and 'Little Man'. 'Sex Tape' is just so lifeless, no good performances across the board.

Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel are notable actors, both can be a bit hit-and-miss but are generally quite solid. This is certainly a low point for those two, as well as for the others involved. The only plus is the cameo from Jack Black, which is mildly amusing.

Safe to say, I would not recommend this. You could probably make a somewhat good production about a sex tape, but I don't get the impression that this lot put much thought into it at all.",2

Unfortunately, while it has comedic elements, it's not a terribly funny movie.  It's more like taking a serious situation and presenting it to someone in a very palatable, if obvious fashion.

This is a ""life is hard"", mixed with ""tragic family event"" tropes with some nice multi-threading for sub plots.

"2243",456,"(Spoilers) Pretty shoe horned script. It was like Reiner wanted a reason and some conflict to get Douglas and Keaton to interact as much as possible. Hmmmm how about estranged drug addict son with secret child? And they're both lonely widowers who happen to live next door to each other in an apartment building, even though they're both obviously wealthy.

Yeah a lot of it doesn't make sense nor is realistic. And they either don't explain why things are happening at all or they explain it way too fast. Douglas' acting is amazing per usual. Keaton is charming is hell.

For some reason, they live in this little apartment complex on a creek in who knows where, they never really say it. And it's always summer. And for some reason, all the neighbors get along, except they hate the grumpy ol' man that usually Jack Nicholson plays, but whoopsie, they already made that movie. 

So how do we make this different? Hmmm....OH! Let's make Douglas super racist. For no reason at all. And the jokes aren't even funny. But it tells the audience RIGHT AWAY, don't like this guy. If the yelling at cute kids wasn't enough, let's tell the Spanish speaking people, he assumes they're poor! And to depict drug addicts, they're like hey let's just combine all the stereotypes into one!

The pathos at times feels a bit theater style. NONE of the minor characters have any backstory. They just exist to push and prod Douglas' character. He behaves poorly and gets whatever he wants, for the most part, which is so back in the day style storylines. It's a man's world right?!

It honestly feels like a tv series. Weird shoe horned first part. The middle is like boring third season dragging on and then end, they're like ok we should wrap this up neatly.

And the cheesy Mad About You music is wild. It's like what decade are we in?

The actual story of  from mythology is hinted at here and there, but not the main focus, because it is too dark for a Disney movie. This is a good movie that I think is worth your time, but there are some interesting creative choices that I think prevent it from being a great movie. James Woods plays the villain, Hades, as a quick talking politician with a temper and he knocks it out of the park. Hades is the stand out character of this film! The story of  becoming a hero devolves in the middle into a social commentary on how we treat our heroes and sports stars. There are quite a few references to Rocky and Michael Jordan throughout the film, which may date it a little. The songs and score were written by Alan Menkin and individually the songs are great. But, there is a duality in them that I question the choice of. Any exposition in the script is told by the Muses and they sing in a gospel style. Using gospel music, a Christian genre, to tell a pagan story is an interesting choice. All the other songs sung by the characters and the score are fairly traditional, with modern twists.

"2280",493,"A multi-layered espionage thriller, A Most Wanted Man is tantalizing, but is that enough to satisfy? I'm split between critics and audience (RT 87/65) on this one. Philip Seymour Hoffman, the king of minuscule movements and idiosyncrasies, is fantastic as Günther Bachmann, a German spy in Hamburg, Germany. The film opens by providing the viewer with context that the plotters of the 9/11 attacks began in Hamburg, a very cool city that is rarely the setting of a film. Günther and his team (Nina Hoss, Daniel Brühl) — which are not affiliated with the local authorities but operate beneath the surface — receive intel that a Chechen refugee (Grigory Dobrygin) who has come into an enormous inheritance, but also is an Islamic Fundamentalist, has arrived in the city. From here, the plot unfolds not with gunfights and car-chase scenes, but with psychological pressure and manipulation. The concept is equated to fishing — using a minnow to catch a barracuda, a barracuda to catch a shark — and I think that's fitting. However, the film falls prey to one of my biggest movie bugaboos: the language. The cast is excellent — PSH, Rachel McAdams, Willem Dafoe, Robin Wright — but with the exception of Wright, the rest play Germans. I'm fine with that, it's acting, but it doesn't make sense for Germans, in Germany, only speaking to other Germans, to speak… English. This isn't a Death of Stalin situation where the actors speak their language (English) in their own accents even though they're playing historical Soviet individuals and it's just part of the movie. If there is an international conversation, then yes, it would almost always make sense for the speakers to default to English, but very often — like most of the movie — entire convos that would be German are in English (with a German accent..) and it's dumb. The ending was a gut-punch that sucks the air out of the room, but what is the message? Wouldn't this ""betrayal"" completely undermine the cooperation between the three parties at play: Günther's team, the German authorities, and the U.S. government? It felt realistic, in a good way, for a spy-movie, and if you can overlook the language issue, it's an enjoyable watch.",4
"2281",494,"A Most Wanted Man escapes the common pitfalls of spy thrillers by retaining an air of plausibility and poignancy throughout, ensuring a heavy harsh departure from pulpy norms. The film portrayed the overbearing interference of high-ranking officials in opposition to terrorism experts in a maddeningly realistic way. One strange feature might be that Americans in Dafoe, Hoffman, and McAdams play the main German roles to leave the more authentic figures such as Bruhl, Hoss, and Krieps in the periphery. I thought that Dafoe performed well. McAdams is one of those who has never really convinced me in any film of hers. I would have much preferred Krieps in a bigger role, even if she hadn't have been a more convincing German (I realise that she is Luxembourgish). Hoffman, if one can move past the shortcomings of his casting, expertly works his craft in his final leading role. He helps to fix into place a superbly flawed principal character already strong from Le Carre's source material. I have not read the book, but everything from the unspoken themes of international weight to the stakes within the film chugs along with a remarkable propensity for finding suspense in governmental processes rather than bombastic action.",4

 I enjoyed taking a peek behind the godfather of hip-hop's life to glimpse how he handled business, how he handled his friends , his ego. James Brown was a man who had cake and wanted to eat every piece of it too. Such a decision landed him in correctional facilities, led to the man having multiple falling outs with his day one's and the women who carried his children. 
 With enough moments to make one feel as if they are attending a James Brown concert , and certainly not shying away from the abuse that Brown suffered and doled out throughout his life , ""Get On Up"" is an entertainer's life lived , allowing one more shot to entertain audiences , and it's non-linear narrative, it succeeds.

As someone who spent high school, college, and post-college as a competitive runner, this movie is insulting and embarrassing to the sport.

If I were in charge, I'd be standing there with a laser pointer, stopping the film and making remarks all the way through. Afterwards, there would be a test. You're lucky I'm not in charge. As long and demanding a watch as this film is, it's not a fraction as long as living through that period of time was, so I don't want to hear any whining. I'm going to make my kids watch this one. I'm  just sorry I didn't do so already. This film is historically accurate, visually lush, well paced. I only wish someone has mentioned just once that Winston's Mother was American. I especially enjoyed seeing the portrayal of the unheated, noisy, uncomfortable pre jet engine airplanes upon which that bulldog of a man was traveling. How many of you have crossed an ocean like that, eh? Did I mention Stalin? All of that is true, his toast to Winston's valet, for instance. Some of us had to study all this at college, spending good money to do so, using these objects called ""books,"" and ""lectures,"" and though I still recommend those methods, a film like this can and should be the shoe horn that gets the student into the subject no matter how woolly the sock of ignorance with which they were fitted.

Klaus Badelt (before, he did with Hans Zimmer - Pirates of the Caribbean) wrote freakin' gorgeous soundtrack, I love: Main Theme, Nightwatcher, Raph Fights Leo, Story of TMNT... + vocal songs from many bands, I love all of them too.
""Get on your feet boys! Rip it Up! Rip it Up! If you're gonna make it!""
Moral of the TMNT (2007) that you should care about family, even if you don't like your brother, after all, he's part of your family.
We can see character growth, this movie is mostly about Raph and Leo,
I appreciate this design of turtles, cuz before (TMNT 2003), Donnie shouldn't be really muscle, here they looks more like teenager, beautiful graphics, I'm glad that Kevin Munroe is director of TMNT (2007), looks cinematically, smooth transitions.
I have rewatched it many-many times, every time I cry... cause most likely we won't see sequel of TMNT (2007), too bad... TMNT (2007) is masterpiece for me, Kevin Munroe, thank you for the best Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles",5

And, while the zombie genre doesn't seem quiet as fresh today, I have to remind myself that this movie is from 2014, the days of the height of the zombie craze. I really appreciate the writing of the zombies in this movie - for the zombies, including Beth, to not be mindless walkers, but mostly normal people for a few days gave the movie some freshness in its approach and story tension.

"2391",604,"Although the whole sci-fi premise was interesting enough to keep watching, the eventual failure in creating depth and detail into the characters turned this movie into one-night fling. The movie keeps you hooked and interested in what's going to happen next, but it can't make you truly connect with its characters and leaves silently with an obscure message. 
To go into some detail, *BEGINNING OF SPOILERS* Sophie's strange naivety and irrationality provokes annoyment, and can't be explained as the nature of long-awaited, unexpected thrill of love. She is simply gone from trying to repair her marriage (in which she apparently had belief in), to being completely delusional, imagining a false future with a dangerous duplicate of her partner, while endangering her actual partner. Also note that, Ethan being the one to blame when Sophie was the one to cheat, is honestly still a mystery to me. This absence of basic reasoning and shallowness of the characters made me disconnect and just keep watching to feed my curiosity for the turn of events. *END OF SPOILERS* 
This movie abandons your mind as its mysteries are over, having failed to reach your heart and carve itself in it. The finale is not bad, but quite predictable after some point. Even though the leading performances were absolutely amazing and especially Moss is worth watching in everything she does, The One I Love was sadly no more to me than a pass-the-time sci-fi story with an efficient hook.",3

"2397",610,"The One I Love is certainly enjoyable, but for me, it was more of an interesting film than a great one. What it does well it does quite well: the leads' good performances, picturesque setting, and fun narrative. It goes down a pretty predictable path once the Black Mirror-like plot reveals itself, but there are still a couple surprises lying in wait including its ever so slight touch of horror ending. I do wish it had gone more ""all in"" with its plot. *Spoilers* Was Ted Danson a psychological criminal mastermind? Were bodies metamorphized to appear different than they were before? The movie is far too light overall to answer these questions, but I can't help but wonder what could have been.",3

Mark Duplass and Elizabeth Moss star as a couple going through marital problems and their therapist, played by Ted Danson, sends them off to a country home for the weekend, where they find that they are not alone. 
The limited cast is great in this and this is a film where you're not overly sure what will happen from scene to scene.   Great flick.",3
"2399",612,"‘The One I Love' is especially rewarding going in without any prior knowledge. This seemingly simple film plays like a seasoned episode of Black Mirror, particularly the kind that explores the emotional risk-assumption of relationships (see ‘The Entire History of You' and ‘Hang the DJ'). Sprinkle in some conceptual whiffs of ‘Eternal Sunshine' and voila.

This is to say that the Charlie McDowell/Justin Lader team may be mining vaguely familiar territory, yet they spin a wholly original marriage yarn that maintains its mystique until the the foreseeable (though still impactful) epilogue. A film this low budget lives or dies on the strength of its acting core and Moss and Duplass are at once believable and intriguing. ‘Love' pulls off a deft balancing act of the whimsical, romantic, supernatural, comedic, and dramatic - all while nurturing a pulse of unease reminiscent of a thriller. For better or for worse, this wields the thought-provoking potential to reconsider the one you love. Dig.",4

I found the movie ridiculously cliche, and it spoon-feeds every single plot point to you. It’s clear that the entire purpose was to make a film as wholesome as humanly possible so that the whole family can watch it. Even the young stars of the film are not allowed to kiss on camera, despite the fact that their romantic feelings are obviously implied throughout the film. It almost feels like one of those church-made movies, but without the heavy-handed Christian messaging. I was most surprised that they were able to get back the entire cast of the first film in order to keep the story going. Dolphin Tale 2 has the feel of a direct-to-video sequel that would just get the same kids and then recast the adults or explain away why the parents weren’t present. Yet they still had a fair number of scenes with Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, and Harry Connick Jr. In fact, one of the weird things was how they tried to shoehorn some of the tertiary characters from the first film into prominent roles in the sequel. For instance, Kyle (the older brother of our main character) suddenly works with the aquarium on some vital level, when he was a complete outsider originally. Despite all its blatant shortcomings, there is a strange warmth that I feel when watching a family film like Dolphin Tale 2. I am fully aware that it’s not a good movie, or a good story, and yet I still care about what will happen in a strange way. I think it makes me nostalgic for the kind of saccharine entertainment I would watch as a kid. I certainly wouldn’t call Dolphin Tale 2 a garbage film, because for its target audience it provides exactly what they are seeking.",2

Dolphin Tale 2 remains inspiring and harmless enough to appeal to families with Rufus the pelican serving as a perfectly serviceable comic relief but it lacks the more effective emotional impact of the first film. Talk about false advertising, Hope - also played by the real dolphin than a dolphin trained into an actor, like Winter, who reappears as herself in this true story sequel -  constantly appears in advertising, yet she doesn't even appear until the last 10 minutes of film...or somewhere within that amount of time.  And time goes by at a REALLY fast pace.  It didn't exactly need to be made, even though when an inspiring true story happens, filmmakers will want to get their hands on the rights for a dramatized film adaptation. So, what do I think of Dolphin Tale 2? Decent acting, some inspiring drama and its friendly nature keep it afloat but DT2 can't be saved from a sense of false advertising and ultimately feeling forgettable. Stick with the first one.",3
"2420",633," truly misrepresents itself; its poster markets it as a horror flix & its trailer makes it look fairly taunt but it's really just a lame thriller that has fallen into obscurity & should stay there.  The direction is terrible where you have Nathalie Baye walking (or running) around Montreal trying to pass itself off as New York (& soft focused to try to pull the wool over the viewers eyes).  John Shea seems like a nice guy (a little obsessive but a nice guy none the less) & when he goes psycho it doesn't quite mesh.

This series started out as rough, tough, cargasm movies, but it has gradually morphed via James Bond/Mission Impossible car-based action movies into, at this point, super-hero movies – Vin Diesel and Jason Statham both display levels of invulnerability which Superman would be proud of. If you thought the 25 mile airport runway in episode 6 was stretching things a bit, wait until you see what happens with the red car in this one. The action is absolutely preposterous, and highly entertaining, even if none of it makes any sense at all (the government seriously has no operatives that can do this kind of thing, so they have to recruit a bunch of freelance drivers to bale out of a cargo plane in their cars? Really?).

Underwriting the whole thing is the knowledge of Paul Walker's death during production, necessitating rewriting and a variety of tricks to bring his character into scenes not filmed at that point. On the whole, this has been fairly well done, and there is little in the way of clunky moments when Walker's absence is obvious, which just leaves the awareness of his death and how that might impact on the story. Credit to the cast and crew for allowing the character to exit the series in a dignified and pleasing way, and for adding a moving coda by way of tribute which is dramatically fitting, thematically appropriate to the character and the saga, and full of obvious love for their lost friend and brother.",4

It is a pile on of over the top scene and the most genuine pretenses in making the characters seem cool. It's all dumb but it's fun and you know what you're getting into, if you're watching the 7th part of this series. I'm sad, that they benched Johnson for better part of the movie. What elevates this part above all others is the famed tribute to Paul Walker. It's tasteful and heartfelt.

"2488",37,"The Longest Ride is a film based on a couple who falls in love, even with their differences. Luke is a bull rider who is looking to make a comeback after an injury. Sophia is an art major who is deeply inspired about art. Luke and Sophia meet at a bull riding show, and they instantly hit it off when they saw each other later that night. One night they saved an elderly man named Ira, an art collector, who would change both of Luke and Sophia's lives. This film had many sweet moments, while still keeping it entertaining. One thing I thoroughly enjoyed was the flashbacks incorporated throughout the film. Ira talked about his wife and how they were able to make their relationship work so well. They showed these moments through flashbacks, and related them to Luke and Sophia's relationship. Ira talked so passionately about his wife, and it was so nice to see the similarities between their love stories. They came from very different generations, but the way they were related was fun to watch. The flashbacks also gave the audience something to relate to through the different generations. Couples watching could easily see how love is the same throughout so many generations and time periods. The audience could also relate those flashbacks to their parents or grandparents. I really enjoyed how it gave the audience something to relate to. Another thing that I really enjoy about this film is how it shows that each person in the relationship has different passions. Luke's passion is bull riding, and Sophia's passion is art. These differences may cause rough patches in relationships, but this film is a great example of how to not let that happen. I really like how Luke fully supports Sophia's dreams. Many times we see the woman just following her partners dreams, rather than her own. Luke is very supportive and this is such a good characteristic of a healthy relationship. Sophia is also supportive of Luke and isn't selfish when it comes to her dreams. I think the film does a good job of staying away from certain stereotypes. Lastly, I enjoyed how much this movie had me on the edge of my seat. I would not consider this a boring movie, as I felt entertained the whole time. The flashbacks definitely contributed to this. It was almost as if there were 2 story lines at once. I think it was a really good balance and wasn't overdone. The flashbacks stayed parallel with the main story line throughout the movie. I also was not able to predict what was going to happen. In many films you can often predict what was going to happen next. I was surprised many times throughout the movie. I was most glad that the ending was not what I expected. It totally took a turn and surprised me. My favorite part of the film was the ending because of how unique it was to other love stories. I was entertained throughout the full movie, and I loved the ending. It is definitely worth the watch.",4

Not to be confused with Venice in the title as the Europe's own Venice. It's a place in Los Agenles, USA.

Indeed, it was about Alex, a middle age working and married woman with a young son. Her husband who takes care of the household, is now deserted them. So in her busy working life, Alex comes to realise the family bonding, particularly with her son. Then there's her dad and sister who are a troublemaker than any useful. So her life with a new perspective begins, like a self-discovery.

This is a directional debut for a supporting actor. He should be directing more films. I really liked it. It was simple and obviously realistic. This thing happens in the real world. So all I felt it was a reflection of someone's real life on the screen. Well written and directed. I liked the cast too. Mary Elizabeth was very good and so the rest of them. This is not an unexpected film, but with its limits it had narrated a fine story. The ratings are not fair. It's surely worth a watch and better than an average.

It was somber to the max, and dreary and painted Communism with about as dark a brush as you could find. The sheer randomness of power, the total arbitrary aspects of government were well displayed. True to history also, Genrik Yagoda was the head of the Secret Police but ended up in front of a firing squad.

This film is no little miss sunshine, but as someone whose life is ruled by, as Dev Patels character Alex says, and Vincent quotes this so brilliantly, I would would give anything to be free from this, but it doesn't stop, and it's not my fault. This film may be full of cliches, but it is written from a place of truth, a place of understanding. Many people live with things they cannot control, some are extreme illnesses, disabilities, others are simply because they are born in a low socioeconomic neighbourhood, or not born with the right genitalia or skin colour that opens all the doors in the world. Regardless, we have our crucibles and they have the ability to make our world smaller and smaller and we get no say over them. This film celebrates the difference, it jokes about the harsh realities (when you could either cry in despair or make the conscious decision to laugh). The story may be one that has been told a thousand times, just with different characters, and let us be honest these are some great characters, but its heart, its point, its is beautiful, honest and truthful. I recommend this movie to anyone, maybe it will show viewers that we do not know what other people are going through so we should never be quick to judge, never be quick to scorn and instead approach everyone as we wish to be treated, with kindness, empathy and love. Highly recommend (but please make sure if you are underage to have a parent or guardian watch with you).",4
"2539",88,"- The Road Within is a circus train wreck -

The circus train wreck that is The Road Within made me uncomfortable and that's kind of the point. I laughed. I cringed. I wanted to turn away. And yet I kept watching.

Writer/director/actress Gren Wells (A Little Bit of Heaven) tells the story of a group of mental misfits who sneak out from their rehabilitation center and head towards the ocean. However, despite its self-proclaimed coming of age angle, The Road Within felt more like an existential meditation on mental illness in modern society and our inability to cure or remove the associated discomfort. The three main characters, Vincent, Alex and Marie, battle Tourette's, OCD, and anorexia, respectively.

I may be slightly biased about the talent in this film. I've been in love with Robert Sheehan (Misfits, Moonwalkers) since my Misfit marathons in college, and Dev Patel (The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) has proved himself a genius actor several lifetimes over since Slumdog Millionaire. The duo are well matched by Zoe Kravitz's (Mad Max: Fury Road, Divergent) choice to embrace the subtly tragic nature of Marie's inability to relinquish control.

I empathized with the characters not because of some logical turns in the plot, but because of these compelling, deeply human performances.

The film opens at the funeral of a mother who drank herself to death; attended by a father politician whose anger issues and narcissism have gone unchecked to the point that he has emotionally disconnected from his son. Even Amy Winehouse, who battled addiction and depression for years before sadly committing suicide, gets a shout-out in a comedic Tourette's filled outburst when Vincent (Sheehan) proclaims ""Amy Winehouse sucks my cock.""

""The Road Within"" is an ensemble circus performed over a backdrop of madness. But the reality of the film is very much akin to the reality of life -- mental illness is pervasive and no one has a real clue what to do about it.

I've watched some of my closest friends and roommates battle bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety. Personally, I've struggled with insomnia. One in ten people in the United States will face an eating disorder in their lifetime, two-thirds of those will be women. Marie's unresolved anorexia is a reminder of the many ways society has gone off the tracks and hasn't yet figured out how to recalibrate.

Vincent best sums up this inability to recalibrate, saying ""there's a clown in my head and he shits in between my thoughts and he forces me to do the most inappropriate thing at the most inappropriate moment. So relaxing is pretty much the one thing I cannot do.""

Relaxing is not something I was able to do watching this film. It was an exercise in empathizing with the more distressed parts of human nature. A very necessary exercise in a world where mental illness is relegated to being the dirty laundry thrown at the bottom of the closet with pills and rehab centers. I shared in the characters' discomfort at the end of the film, particularly because it didn't tie things up in a neat bow. Many of the core issues were simply left unresolved.

Despite several cliché and poorly handled plot metaphors as well as an on-the-nose title, The Road Within is an uncomfortable cinematic journey that I didn't know I needed to take but am glad I did.

It's a beautiful reminder that we are all battling demons, and while we may never slay the beast, we can look into its beady clown eyes from time to time, and say ""Thanks for bearing witness.""

"2541",90,"A patient with Tourett's syndrome becomes friends with a guy with OCD and a girl suffering from anorexia.  Together they go on a trip that gives them a sense of ""being"" by just enjoying their company and nature.  The acting was very good and you begin to care about the characters going through all their problems.  Though the film has its touching moments, it didn't really draw me in emotionally like other films in this genre.  Overall, this is a GOOD movie.  3/5  OR  6/10",3
"2542",91,"Very dumb movie, nothing clever going on here. I'd recommend watching with friends to make fun of while watching",2

"2544",93,"The found footage genre in horror seems to be more of an acquired taste to fans of the horror genre, and I got to say that this movie just doesn't do it enough for me. It starts off strong with a lot of mystery and builds tension well throughout the entire course of the movie until the last scene. However, the deaths of each character were all very underwhelming and most of them felt very rushed, except for the third one which actually added a lot to the stories of the characters in the call and not just Laura's story. I also felt this movie ages itself very poorly and watching it for the first time anytime after 2015 makes it seem ancient, but then again at some points it served as a bit of a nostalgic touch seeing websites like the old YouTube site. Overall, this movie is stuck between being awful and just okay, so I'm going to give it a 2/5. Besides a few moments of tension and some funny moments of teens being idiots, this movie is just a bad execution of an otherwise interesting idea for a horror film.",2
"2545",94,"I was pleasantly surprised with the majority of this movie. This was the first major ""screenlife""-format movie and it makes good use of this gimmick. It translates more traditional eerie (and sometimes outright terrifying) horror tropes to a virtual format very effectively while capturing the essence of the late-2000s creepypasta-style internet horror. In addition, there are also quite a few unique scares that could only happen via a computer screen. 

There are some effective moments of morality regarding cyberbullying and general teenage shittiness, although the movie doesn't really have anything new to say that hasn't been said many times before. The cast is all pretty good, especially the male characters who accurately portray high school boys' ability to act tough and then immediately break down crying when they don't get what they want. The script for the female characters leans a little too heavily into generic ""cat fights"" and he-said-she-said drama for my taste, though.

This film struggles a bit with suspension of disbelief. I found myself distracted when the Skype conversation would abruptly go silent whenever something else was happening on ""our"" screen, which is ironic because I'm certain that decision was made to avoid distraction. Some of the characterizations are a bit loose as well - at one point, a character learns the ""key"" to defeating the enemy, only to conveniently ignore that information for the sake of a reveal at the end of the film.

I would have loved to have given this 4 stars, but there's a stupid, obnoxious jump scare stinger just before the credits start. I hate those, and so does everyone else. And the worst part is that this film didn't even need it - it had plenty of scares, both slow and abrupt. So that pissed me off. But up until that point, this was a 4-star film with fresh ideas, dark and interesting themes, and some excellent gore.",4
"2546",95," is a horror movie with a fresh new take. With the entire movie being inside of a laptop, the writers and director are all challenging themselves to bring a good movie to the table.

At a lot of points they got it right, but unfortunately they missed the mark on crucial points.

"2549",98,"With a fresh idea that manages to squash usual Horror film cliches,  becomes repetitive at times with dumb character decisions here and there but that can't camouflage the strong acting, stunning narrative and a talented use of sound effects and suspenseful cinematography making  scarier than I expected.",4
"2550",99,", from academic and filmmaking standpoints, is actually pretty interesting because other than literally the final second of the movie, the entire thing takes place on a computer screen, making it really unique and unlike anything I'd ever seen before.  has college level concepts in it that make it worth watching despite its flaws and manages to exploit and add anxiety to things that commonly happen on computers that we don't normally make a big deal about. These things happen frequently and they mean nothing to us, but they mean a lot to the characters in this movie and heighten the fear and horror despite how relatively minor they are. The structure of this movie will be very familiar to teens and young adults in the era of modern technology which gives it a sense of relatability that I did appreciate. The way the characters react to each other and the horror component of this movie is extremely realistic and accurate of how people would react in the real world, as is the way they respond to it. They take appropriate actions to attempt to deal with the horror part of this movie, something I also liked. In general,  doesn't rely on protagonist curiosity/stupidity to further along the plot or make the movie go in a totally new direction; the characters try to be as smart as they can be to resolve the conflicts in the movie, even if some of those resolutions aren't too pretty. The horror itself isn't bad; the movie (spoiler alert) manages to make a glitch of someone staring at a camera frozen really scary and probably the most terrifying moment of the whole movie. A lot of the horror in this movie is stupid, but that shot wasn't and was effective. Unfortunately,  suffers from a lot of story and plot stupidity and important things not making sense. There were other ways this movie could've been executed that would been much better for me and caused the components that didn't make sense to make a lot more sense, which would've helped the film flow better overall. I don't fully understand what was causing the characters to have the fates that they did since my understanding was that the supernatural presence was limited to the computer screen, and yet many scenes in the movie suggest otherwise. The core premise of this movie doesn't work too well for me which is disappointing because the structure is really interesting.  got close to being a really enjoyable movie for me and really just suffers from things not making sense and flowing badly which causes it to falter at crucial moments when it could've really shined and been an effective work of art in the horror genre.",2

The first half of this movie tries to be more of a lighthearted comedy, but the jokes didn’t really land for me and it felt a little slow. They could’ve cut out about 15 minutes of the first half.

First, Adaline is a bland, soft spoken, vapid, beige shell of a woman, which is quite  maddening given her length on this earth. They tried showing her intelligence through being multi-lingual and a knack for trivia but somehow it wasn't convincing. The message this movie sends is that the only thing Adaline has going for her is her looks. Thank goodness she doesn't age.

Let's be honest, if Ellis wasn't a good-looking, successful white guy, he would be a creepy psychopath stalker. Making douchey comments about how she should've introduced herself, forcefully not leaving when she had asked him to, and making borderline sexist remarks like ""pink is for girls"". I'm 5 years late to the game, I get it. but in any year, this guy would be a huge red flag.

"2585",134,"A very Scottish film, not always easy to follow the dialect. Similar to Whiskey Galore it's set back in the day when the Scotts were a friendly people. Has some funny moments and could be one of the very few loch and canal versions of a ""road movie"".",3
"2586",135,"The  is one of Ealing Studios finest comedies.  It is director Alexander MacKendrick's take on modern versus traditional views in Scotland after the 2d WW and on American corporate values in Britain.  The interplay is quite interesting, when one considers that MacKendrick was an American who was raised in Scotland and eventually returned to live in the U.S.

One senses a longing on the part of the writer, William Rose, for a vanishing coastal Scotland, and all the values that were incorporated by that rural society.  

The story began as others in Glasgow represented new values and the Captain of the , played by Alex MacKenzie, and his crew encountered problems in this urban atmosphere in which they were so out of play.
 
The lead character, called the American and played Paul Douglas, was an even greater displacement for the crew of the  but could even be seen as pushing along his own employees as he referred to some as being incompetent and one mentioned that when she sought to leave he doubled her salary.  He believed that his modern fixations with time being an obsession and money being of paramount importance were even somewhat much for the Scottish in Glasgow of the early 1950s.

The comedy works because, the American and his employees are forced to adopt to a mode of life in which we can all empathize.  Although the 's captain is a bit of a scoundrel, his purpose is never self profit, it is merely to keep his ship operating.  

The American who is defrauded, and he is without a doubt, has vindictive motives, is overbearing and does not gain any sympathy until he undergoes a series of humiliating experiences, most of which are surprisingly instigated by the cabin boy, who would be the hero if there was one.  

Some comments regarding the cabin boy.  The lad certainly is the catalyst for much of the action that causes the plot to move.  To reveal too much would be inappropriate, however, it suffices to say that the arrest of the assistant, the dock, the washboard and so forth were all at this instigation.  It does make the one weakness in the plot construction as it is a bit too convenient and easy for my taste.  That said, it does work doesn't it.

All in all, a wonderful movie.",5

It includes a memorable scene of a Céilidh (gathering, often with music and dance) that is a genuine rarity in its authenticity. Film lovers may be more familiar with better known classics like Whisky Galore (also directed by Alexander MacKendrick) and Powell & Pressburger's I Know Where I'm Going, but The  is not to be dismissed.

The music is sometimes alright but not enough to prop up the half of the film or more spent in some of the most cliched performances and scripting that I have ever seen put into practice. The romances are all obscenely underdeveloped, dull, and unnatural. No performance suggests a hint of chemistry with the rest of the cast. Anna Kendrick has had serious dramatic roles to mixed effect but this must have set her progress back. Hailee Steinfeld fits into the same category. Rebel Wilson's character is obnoxious and her entire character one massive fat joke that was not funny to begin with. As a throwaway, casual flick, perhaps one could do worse and the badness of proceedings can provide an encouraging familiarity, but Pitch Perfect 2 is as reprehensible as films can become and falls apart every time the characters step off of the stage.",2

Anna Kendrick (Beca) doesn't really do anything, at least very little that's even close to being memorable. Skylar Astin (Jesse) takes a back seat, which I don't actually think is a negative. Adam Devine (Bumper) and Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) aren't as amusing, though the story featuring those two probably did interest me most. Hailee Steinfeld, meanwhile, is an alright addition.

The characters are also done very well (minus a couple of them) and are presented in a very likeable way. The issue that I have is that it just feels too by-the-books and predictable, where just about every trope that you can imagine being used in a horror film is used.

"2636",185,"The story behind this film is both inspiring and unbelievable. Arielle Holmes was a homeless New York crack addict in her early twenties. Shortly after her recovery, while she was an intern at a New York jewel shop, the Safdie brothers discovered her during research for another film (you can probably deduce which one). They advised her to write a memoir. She did so, and they adapted it for the big screen with Holmes herself playing a fictionalized version of herself, not as Arielle but as Harley, a character going through events painfully similar to the real thing, roaming the streets of New York City with other young people lost in the folly of drugs.

You don't get to see this level of authenticity in a film too often. Filming exclusively on location, Josh and Benny Safdie prove with their first somewhat mainstream film that neorealistic blood goes through their veins. With the help of Holmes' excruciatingly real performance, they tell a story of suffering, addiction and toxic relationships (in the most literal sense).

Still, what I find most exceptional in Heaven Knows What and also what makes it a challenging and fascinating exercise in filmmaking is the slightly expressionistic meat on the neorealistic bones, with an eerie soundtrack and some neon-lighted shots that effectivelly transport you right inside Harley's scarred heart. The Safdies would eventually flesh out this side to their directorial personas in the later, excellent Good Time. This is where they demonstrated what visceral filmmakers they are, their unique style pulsating in every shot of their career.",5

At least the weather felt really nice on that warm February night. Walking to a bar. I needed a drink. Listening to Radiohead in my headphones. Music that always help me to move forward from mixed feelings that I can catch every now and then. 

The movie has an intense violence on the sentiments. Everything seems to be on point to truly fuck you up in the head like the characters in the picture. The dirt. The pain. The need. The lost possibilities. Replay again and again. 

The perfect elements put together. A book written by Arielle Holmes. Mad Love in New York. A fiction of her own life in a movie where she plays her story. She's the main character. Ariel Pink is in charge of the music. Putting the mind of the Safdie brothers behind the camera and the result is a unique piece of art. A masterpiece. 

I thought Good Times was out of this world but it has just been over passed by Heaven Knows What. I must watch Uncut Gems and all the other Safdie brothers early work now.

The cinematography techniques used in Me and Earl and The Dying Girl were such simple techniques but used in such a way where it really impacts the film. To show the separation between the two protagonists, Greg and Rachel, the cinematographer employs a simple technique, keep them separated. In the beginning of the relationship when they shared the screen one character was significantly smaller than the other allowing us to see the distance between them. Utilizing a deep focus, both characters can be seen in focus but yet the distance is still there. 

As the film progresses, when the two characters share the screen they appear to be much closer either in a simple two shot or over the shoulders. Once act three happens and the characters are divided we go back to the distance once again.

There's one scene in the film where the two characters are verbally fighting. It's a 5 minute one take of nothing but great performances by the actors. This simple technique allows the audience to choose who they want to listen to. It gives the scene a real theater feel.

It's strangely disjointed and hard to describe. It doesn't really take itself seriously---or if it does, the filmmaker and writer are greatly deluded.
It's another ""new weird guy moves into suburban neighborhood"" movie, which has been done innumerable times. But this time, it's not just the new guy who's weird; it's everybody on the block. One guy has a gambling addiction. The main character (Steven Weber) has OCD, his kid has phobias and neuroses, and his wife has an inexplicable attraction to the new guy, a shady psychiatrist who has lost his license (Eriq LaSalle).
Weirdness abounds, and none of it explained. LaSalle's character drives a 1960's Mercury with big tail fins. Weber's character slowly goes insane and ends up shaving his head. 
When his kid disappears, Weber begins to suspect that LaSalle has kidnaped him. He also suspects that LaSalle is abusing women in his basement. I kept watching just to learn the answer to the mystery, and I have to say I was surprised, even though I should have seen it coming.

As so many other Germans, from that period, he also finds the peace terms of Versailles, humiliating and provocative. They make all their war efforts and sacrifices at the front, useless. 

So Hitler wants respect and he wants revenge. Not only for him, but also for Germany and the German people. As so many other hateful veterans, throughout the bloody history of mankind, Hitler also attempts to find activities, enabling him to let off steam, and make him feel respected. 

And in this movie, destiny pick a Munich art dealer, who happens to be Jewish, helping Hitler out of fear, to figure out what type of activity, will help him the most.

Eventually, Hitler figures out, that Art + Politics = Power. imum Power, naturally.
His lust for power is a narcissistic effort, distancing him from his own dysfunctionality (read: self-hatred).

The movie also portray the young Adolf Hitler, developing in two stages; 
1. from desperation to control behavior 
2. from control to dominance behavior

It is an important movie, to anyone wanting to understand, why humiliation turn into violence. 
I give it Top Rate and thank the entire crew, for making it happen. The humankind need many more movies in this category. They can save lives.

This time around, Ted (the voice of Seth MacFarlane) has married Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) and, in order to save their marriage, have decided to start a family.  However, the process becomes complicated when it is deemed that Ted is legally considered property and not a person with rights.

Sigue teniendo momentos muy graciosos e ingeniosos, causando bastantes risas durante toda la película, lo cual siempre suma; a pesar de eso también tiene algunos chistes malos o una repentina repetición de los chistes, haciendo que ya cansen. En cuanto a la película, me pareció muy divertida y con una trama con un ritmo bastante bueno que además lo acompañan los momentos divertidos. En cuanto a algo malo, me pareció algo forzado lo que hicieron con el personaje de Lori al saber que Mila Kunis no repetiría su papel; sin embargo el personaje de Amanda Seyfried me gustó. Otra cosa mala es la vuelta del personaje de Donny, muy innecesario y forzado para darle algún conflicto a la trama. Por otro lado, las actuaciones me gustaron mucho y en esta secuela suma estrellas importantes en papeles secundarios y terciarios como Morgan Freeman y Liam Neeson, lo cual siempre es muy bueno.

"2717",266,"NOTE: There is no rule banning heterosexual men from seeing these movies simply because their premise is about male strippers. You are free to watch whatever you choose and like what you like. They won't magically turn you gay and even if you do get turned on, just remember, bisexuality exists. It's still an unhealthy prejudiced belief to assume that all bisexuals are just people suffering from ""gay denial""
REVIEW: Magic Mike XXL doesn't have much of a plot - hell, after the big climax at the convention, the movie just ends - compared to its predecessor and seems to ignore what message there was in the first film about the titular character's life being quite empty and deconstruction of that glamorous lifestyle. And yet, I prefer this sequel over the sleeper hit from 2012. Mainly because it fixes certain problems the first movie had by keeping the focus solely on Channing Tatum's character, getting rid of all the orange and getting rid of the terrible sister of The Kid (who doesn't appear in this movie due to Alex Pettyfer clashing with Tatum on set during the first film) who served as a love interest for Mike. Oh, and while I think the stripping sequences are better choreographed in the first film, the ones we see in this movie are still pretty good in their own right, and you don't necessarily have to be aroused to enjoy them. I'm not gay but I did admire the hell of a job the actors did with one moment in the climax concerning mirrors...watch the movie, or at least a clip of it on YouTube, you'll see what I mean. Even without the beefcake that'll get girls and the G & B in LGBT to see this movie, one thing I did like was the camarederie between the cast which I didn't think we got enough of in the first film. Perhaps being a road trip movie coupled with a noticeably more lighthearted tone helped in that regard. Magic Mike XXL isn't seeking to break any new ground, it does it's job and does it well. Whether it be the fanservice or the camarederie, I'm sure you can find something of value in this sequel.",4
"2718",267,"The story is not quite as strong as the original but it's so much more fun and features much more likable characters.

The chemistry of the romantic leads didn't work for me, maybe it was the 14 year difference between the actors or the way it was written. He seemed to come on too strong toward someone who just escaped an abusive marriage. I also question the film quality. I watched this on Disney+, along with other movies made before this, and this film looked like it was filmed on a cheap camera.

"2725",274,"Disney presents another movie about the disabled community. Jenny Agutter stars as  in the 1900s. She leaves her rich socialite life behind from her overbearing lawyer husband and takes a position at a school for children. This school in particular houses the blind and deaf. Many of them come from Appalachian families whom have given up on them having normal lives.
Later she falls in love with a doctor Ben played by Barry Newman. During her teachings she of course faces doubt and opposition of whether or not people with hearing impairments can actually communicate. Plus the school barely has any funds for anything. 
 also has to prove herself to her husband that she wants her own freedom and not be chained to the chambers of his lifestyle. Plus we understand why they both distanced themselves; they had a child but he was born with the same conditions as these kids she's teaching.
It shouldn't matter if someone's capable of having normal children, they still can be loved despite the limitations, just because someone is disabled doesn't mean they should be relegated to their own kind, it's true people don't know how to act around the deaf fearing they won't mix well with others, the only thing that's wrong is to deny how we really feel, everything costs something but only we can know if it's worth it, can a word truly make a difference?
Jenny Agutter is so sensational in this role. She's a great teacher learning to love while also having the kids learning from her. She belongs to herself. Plus it's great that this is another Disney flick that appeals to the handicapped showing they're not impossible to help. We can all learn from each other just by listening rather than simply hearing.",4
"2726",275,"A very sweet film, one with its heart truly in the right place.

I had a fine time watching ''. There's a few very touching moments, alongside a few shocking parts too; one particularly surprised the hell out of me, the most a Disney film has so far in fact. Those come amongst the storyline which entails blind and deaf children, as well as a bit of women's empowerment in there too. They blend it together nicely.

Jenny Agutter is excellent in the titular role, I felt connected to her story whilst also getting the required sense care and charm that her character is intended to have. Otto Rechenberg, one of many deaf/blind people cast, is very good. All the main ones onscreen do a noteworthy job, in fairness.

Enjoyable and hearty. Watch it.",4

A very accurate portrayal. It is also feminist! The protagonist , leaves her possessive husband, who sent his disabled son to an institution to help deaf children learn to speak which most people consider impossible.

All the characters here are paper-thin and clichéd, they make stupid decisions to put themselves needlessly in peril.

But generally there isn't much peril, or danger, or scares. Distractingly amateurish, The Gallows looked as if it was shot for fifty quid in a spare weekend.

"2754",303," is relentlessly morose, and it quickly becomes tiresome. 
It's a story of a family that has relocated to a seedy, bleak town in the Australian Outback to escape a sex scandal in their previous town involving their teenage daughter and a teacher. The town looks like something from an old western, even though the story takes place in present  day. 
The parents, Catherine and Matthew Parker (Nicole Kidman and Joseph Fiennes), have their hands full with their sullen prepubescent son Tom (Nicholas Hamilton) and their moody and annoying 15 year old daughter Lilly (Maddison Brown). On top of that, there is a unexplained strain on their relationship that keeps them sleeping separately. Their verbal exchanges are terse and full of resentful subtexts.
Not a happy family, and not a happy movie. It nearly collapses under the weight of its own angst.
The plot involves the kids disappearing in the middle of the night after a nasty dust storm. Lilly has been sexually involved with some of the young local males, and maybe she was kidnaped, but that doesn't explain why Tom is gone, too. Lilly is the kind of kid you would like to slap. She's disrespectful and arrogant, and she spends her free time writing awful poetry (which we are unfortunately subjected to in voice-overs). Tom is angry and laconic. If I were their parent, I'd be glad they disappeared. 
The Parkers enlist the help of the local lawman Rae (Hugo Weaving, playing the closest thing to a likeable character in the entire film). But the procedural aspect of the search is constantly overshadowed by the focus on the miseries of all the characters. Bad marriage, depression, regret, repressed anger….I kept patiently enduring all of the melodrama just to find out what happened to the kids. By the halfway point, I was getting restless---and the movie is a full two hours.
We eventually discover that Lilly has apparently inherited her promiscuity from her mother, who ends up trying to seduce one of Lilly's boyfriends---while her daughter is missing?!! I guess that explains the marital problems. And I'm sad to say, things get even more absurd.
As to the denouement: There is none. Sorry for anybody who expected one. But at least we spent two hours feeling dismal.",1

Slow down!"" and he was like ""It's okay, we're f'ing!""...No. You should always be able to reverse the roles in sexual scenarios and have them still be consensual. There are ways to draw out a sexually aggressive character without doing this.

Plus, there was a shooting at a theatre during this film's showing, and now Hollywood's like ""Time for a sequel!"". No. Take the warnings from the universe. How many theatrical releases can you think of where a shooting took place? The real life Joker came out during ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and assassinated a bunch of people, and...""."" 

What I do like about Amy is she is backing sexual assault victims left and right.

I will check out her new TV series when it comes out, and since it's on Hulu, she can feel safe in knowing that all of us trolls go where it's open season at throwing rotten tomatoes at the actors heads like we did at Medieval Days, as there are still some sites that won't censor public opinion.

"2799",348,"A No Heavy Tearjerker, But Still Searingly Relatable and Sentimental
Coming on the heels of its commercially-successful predecessor, 'The Fault in Our Stars', PAPER TOWNS is no heavy tearjerker, but it echoes more affectionate and piercing sentiments, with its lighter, minimalist take of its recognizable subjects.

The film follows Quentin (Nat Wolff) , or ""Q"" as he is more popularly called, a highschool boy who has been nursing an unrequited love for the girl living next door, Margo (Cara Delevigne) since childhood. Even after when they turn 12, when Margo suddenly becomes distant, ""Q"" never loses the affection, and it only becomes even stronger when one day she climbs again to his window, the way she did when they were still kids. The next events follow an eager ""Q"" savoring the moment as he escorts Margo in her series of ""small revenge"" against those she thinks have betrayed her, including her ex-boyfriend. But the levitating moment would only last overnight, because the next day, the ever mystifying Margo, disappears.

Mining on the same overly familiar material that dwells on both coming-of-age and teenage romance territories, PAPER TOWNS pulls off two easily-recognizable efforts: maintaining 'The Fault's charm, while toning down its tragic notions. The latter of which, yields a more tangible and heartwarming result, capable of conjuring a lasting tug at the heartstrings. The credit for this goes to its equally-charming yet capable actors, both of whom teeming with fresh and enigmatic likability. It will also sound unforgivable to never pay regard to the film's brilliant screenwriters who manage to cleverly highlight this extremely familiar highschool tale's stronger and more relatable sentiments, genuinely and sincerely enough, to bend fragile emotions with crippling capacity.

""Q""'s road trip in finding Margo represents a bigger journey with far wider scope and meaning, and it comes across as a process of personal exploration that unknowingly liberates one self, toward finding the deeper sense of their existence. Hardly that the questions thrown get resolved, but the charming and sincere take of its proceedings, will ultimately make the narrative arrive to a satisfying conclusion. This doesn't mean it's able to satisfy its own queries, but the resolution delivered are nonetheless, reliable and honest.

PAPER TOWNS will come across as a witty, yet touching case of a 'lost and found'. Much of it is spent in searching for the 'lost', a liberating process that frees its seekers from every question that unfolds in the wake of a previous other, but the 'found', though never really answers any of the previous questions, will deliver a surprisingly satisfying, and never less of a rewarding, answer.",5

And then she disappears and they go on this adventure to find her and once they find her she's all like I was just sending those clues to tell you I was fine which is so ridiculously stupid that it's frustrating.

I was surprised because The Vatican Tapes actually starts with a pretty cool opening montage and then shows us Djimon Hounsou as Vicar Imani paired with Peter Andersson and his un-placeable Northern European accent as Cardinal Bruun. You'd expect these two, who are watching recordings of obviously possessed American, Angela, from Rome to jet-set to the States and start kicking some demonic ass. Well, you'd be wrong. Instead, these two aren't seen for quite some time and instead, we see the weird story of Angela, boyfriend, Pete (John Patrick Amedori), and Dad (Dougray Scott), cope with her possession in awkwardly acted and paced scenes. When it's time to finally bring in the calvary (religious pun FTW), we only get Bruun, who delivers one of the dumbest lines I've ever heard in an exorcism movie: ""Sometimes, we must move away from God."" … Excuse me? You're a priest, performing an exorcism, and you don't want the help of Jesus Christ?? **Spoiler Alert** the exorcism lasts like 7 minutes, it fails, Angela is the literal anti-Christ, etc. etc. etc. Some moments were okay (dislocating joints while in restraints, pretty standard), others were just weird (spitting up 3 eggs, which forms the Holy Trinity??), and Djimon is in one more scene towards the end just to make the viewer feel like they weren't completely swindled.

Mental illness has its own stigmas without religious mysticism  continuing to muddy the waters. This is a soggy piece of white bread sandwich someone left on the counter. The narrative is a flavorless smear at differentiating magic from mental health while mashing them together at the same time. There are some nice performances - but the performances are at their best with exposition monologues.

Never in a million years could I picture her as a rock star, but she makes it work. Her singing? Well, it's not good but it's not bad either. And the fact that Rick Springfield played her boyfriend was a nice bonus. He's still an amazing musician, decades after ""Jessie's Girl"". I hated the character of Meryl's daughter. Just an awful, hateful person. Granted she had good reason for her bitterness, but it was a little much. On the flip side, I really liked Kevin Kline as the ex-husband and I liked the men who played her sons. This movie is not a comedy at all, and there were very rare laughable moments. I'm glad I watched the whole thing because the ending made up for any shortcomings of the movie.

"2823",372,"GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, don t lose that number, it s time to review Ricki and the Flash.

SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Ricki has some splainin to do. Let s recap.

GREG: We re introduced to Ricki Rendazzo (Meryl Streep), an aging rocker working bars and honky tonks and playing songs from the classic age of rock and roll - with an occasional diversion into Pink. She s barely making ends meet between her gigs and clerking at the grocery store, when she gets a call from her ex-husband that their 20-something daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer) has attempted suicide.

SCOTT: Ricki scrapes up enough money to fly to Indianapolis to give her daughter Julie some emotional support. She s too poor to stay at a hotel and so she stays with her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) who lives in a mansion with his current wife Maureen (Audra McDonald). Ricki must deal with Julie s resentment toward her, and the awkwardness of her visit is compounded by the arrival of her other two children and Maureen herself.

GREG: Scott, there s nothing really interesting about this story. Unless you are a fan of Meryl Streep. As usual, she gives a great performance. She reminds me of Bonnie Raitt from the 90 s. Frankly, I thought she sauntered through this role. It didn t look like much of a stretch for her. On the other hand, Streep s own daughter plays the role of Julie. Gummer does a passable job as the spoiled and distraught daughter. Ricki brings a certain chaos to Pete s life which is otherwise quite bland. And it looks as though that chaos is what attracted Pete to Ricki in the first place. The story goes through the usual paces with Ricki telling her daughter to skip therapy and take a spa day. There s also a run-in with the new wife who held the family together in Ricki s absence. And then there s the bisexual son who is really gay but never told Ricki. It s all very run of the mill without a lot of real conflict. Just situations where conflict might exist.

SCOTT: It s a good story, Greg. The problem is that everything that happens is too predictable and too saccharine. Ricki starts out estranged from just about everyone -- her band member Greg (Rick Springfield), her ex-husband, all her children. Because shes not a bad person, we know that by the end of the story she ll have bonded with everyone. The question then becomes how does Ricki s life change. What we find is that the transformation of all these relationships occurs in unsurprising ways. In-between all these predictable events we re treated to a lot, and I do mean a lot, of Meryl Streep belting out 70s rock tunes. She does an amazing job, but what we really have here is a 45-minute movie with a 90-minute playing time.

GREG: As a hero, Ricki is very flawed. She is insensitive to her boyfriend - refusing to admit she  loves  him or that they are dating. She left her children to be a rock star - a goal that never materialized. She apparently spent little time with her kids as they grew up - letting another woman raise them. It s only her relaxed lifestyle and clear affection for her children that redeems her to us. And it s enough to allow us to sympathize with her and root for her to do well.

SCOTT: It s interesting that we never see Ricki behave poorly as a wife to Pete or as a mother to her three children. We only see her as a sympathetic figure, a woman trying to atone for her past mistakes and who ends up doing a fine job with her redemption. It s nice that everyone ends up forgiving her, accepting her, and loving her in the end, but this resolution seems unrealistic. And maybe thats the point -- we dont ever see dysfunctional families doing a big group hug at the end, but we sure would like to. The supporting cast does a workmanlike job in this film. Rick Springfield surprised me with his acting chops. Pete and the kids are pretty much stock characters who make our hero s life difficult for a while, but they soften in the end, much like Ricki has softened. Perhaps  soft  is the key term here -- this movie is soft in many, not very flattering ways. Like you said, Greg, Streep shows off her vast talents here, but this film is nevertheless a light, fluffy, made-for-TV movie.

GREG: I liked the second wife in this movie - Maureen. She s a strong woman who stepped into the hole that Ricki left. It s an interesting dynamic between Maureen and Ricki. There s a sense that Maureen successfully eased Ricki out of her children s lives. Then, when Ricki returns to California, Maureen has a change of heart and invites Ricki to her son s wedding. Or was it a change of heart? Was Maureen aware that Ricki wouldn t have the funds to fly back? Regardless, it is her boyfriend Greg who sells his Stratocaster so that Ricki can attend the wedding. And that raises a question for me about secondary heroes. Greg is a secondary character, but he is a sort of martyr. He gives up something of great value to him, so that the hero of the story can have something she wants. He s an enabler of sorts - or in the lexicon of our book  Reel Heroes and Villains  - a catalyst for Ricki s change.

SCOTT: Ricki and the Flash is a pleasant movie about an aging mom who was once a bad mother and is now given a chance to redeem herself. This theme is a common one in today s movies -- witness films such as 3 Days To Kill, Snitch, and A Good Day To Die Hard. The baby-boomer generation is apparently desperate to make amends to the younger generation for its self-indulgent ways. Ricki isn t a bad movie but I won t be giving it a second look. The film deserves about 2 Reels out of 5. Our hero Ricki is on a journey of redemption. She has no mentors, really, and on her own she relies on kindness, loyalty, and patience to win the hearts of her grown children. Perhaps these are the missing qualities that Ricki needed to achieve her redemption, but we are given no insight into how she acquired them. The hero journey is thus a bit stunted. I award Ricki 2 Heroes out of 5. The supporting characters are adequate but unmemorable. When I think back to this movie, all I ll really remember is Streep s excellent performance as Ricki and as a rock n roll wanna-be star. Generously I ll award the supporting characters 2 rating points out of 5.  Movie: Cast:  Heroes:

GREG: Agreed on all counts, Scott. Ricki and the Flash is merely a vehicle for Streep s daughter, Gummer, to have a bit of the spotlight. Perhaps art imitates life as Streep gives something back to her own daughter. We ve seen this in other films like Will and Jaden Smith in The Pursuit of Happyness (2006) and again in Beyond Earth (2013). Movie history is rife with nepotism. I give Ricki and the Flash just 2 out of 5 Reels. The hero story is pretty simple. Ricki does go through a transformation in that she reconnects with her children. And she realizes that she loves her boyfriend Greg and has to accept him as her lover or lose him. She has been pushing people away her whole life and finally realizes she has to be less selfish. I give her 3 out of 5 Heroes. The secondary characters are pretty boilerplate, two-dimensional cutouts. The husband is a bland businessman, the second wife is heartless, the kids are a selection of Lifetime tropes (depressed daughter, yuppie son, and gay son). The character I liked most was Greg the boyfriend because it is his sacrifice that tilts the scales and catalyzes Ricki into the transformation she needs. And he has a likable name. I give the supporting cast 2 out of 5 Cast points. Movie: Cast: Heroes:",2

Verwunderlich ist eigentlich nur, dass der Film auf den Index gelangte, wegen den Gewaltdarstellungen. Ehrlich gesagt, gibt es Heute mehr ausgeklügelte Gewaltorgien und die sind sogar ab 16 Jahren.
Fazit: Einmal reicht. Es fehlt auch den weiblichen Touch. Die Insel ist ein Klischeehafter Männertraum!",2

"2846",395,"Beautiful, thoughtful, quiet, poignant, and true.
This film is excellent. Top-notch writing, entirely driven by strong characterization without contrivances. The acting is excellent, and the dialogue is believable, natural, and honest. This is not your average romcom, and it might not even qualify as a romcom at all, because although it asks many of the kinds of questions that romcoms try to ask, it answers them with far more maturity than most do. This story has themes that resonate and an ending that delivers. There are moments of the transcendent alongside moments of the awkward, and that gives the experience a ring of realism. The personal mysteries are revealed at a good pace, and the story never becomes saccharine, boring, or entirely predictable. I appreciated the good use of silence. I was occasionally annoyed by the unnecessary shakiness of the hand-held camera or the blurry focus of foreground objects, but that only happened a couple of times. This is otherwise a beautiful, thoughtful, quiet, poignant, and true character piece, and it's well worth the watching.",5

"2861",410,"SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, it s a perfect time to review this next movie.

GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Yes, it s Fatal Attraction for a new generation. Lets recap.

SCOTT: Thirty-six-year-old Leah (Sanaa Lathan) and her boyfriend Dave (Morris Chestnut) are having relationship woes. She can feel her biological clock ticking away, and she wants to have a family. But Dave doesn t. The issue is a dealbreaker for her, so she dumps him. Now Leah is back in the dating world, trying to get over Dave and move on with her life...

GREG:   when she meets Carter (Michael Ealy) - a very nice guy who brings flowers to her mother and Giants tickets to her father. He ingratiates himself to Leah, her family, and her best friends. But one night while getting gas, Carter get jealous when a man is admiring his car - which Carter mistook for unwelcome admiration of Leah. Carter beats the living tar out of the man. Leah tells him she never wants to see him again, but Carter begins stalking her. Leah appeals to the police but their hands are tied. Now it s a game of cat and mouse as Carter advances, and Leah retreats.

SCOTT: Greg, by calling itself The Perfect Guy, this movie gives away its premise, namely, that some poor woman is going to fall for a guy who seems too good to be true -- and is. So right off the bat, we know exactly what will happen, but we don t know how it will happen. The strength of the movie lies in its execution: Are the characters interesting, do they have depth, do they grow or change in any significant way, does the hero captivate us, etc. In short, can this movie overcome its self-inflicted predictability? Sadly, the answer to all these questions is  not so much . To be sure, this is a movie that is hard to dislike, thanks in large part to the sweet girl-next-door appeal of our hero Leah, who has a good heart and rotten luck with men. Her first beau, Dave, isn t a bad guy at all; he just isn t ready for children. We can t even blame Leah for falling for Carter, who does and says all the right things. Herein lies the appeal of the story. We ve all been in Leah s shoes. We know what a risk it is to meet complete strangers and begin dating them. We ve all seen Fatal Attraction and in the back of our minds lurks the fearful possibility that we re falling for a Glenn Close-like character.

GREG: The Perfect Guy reminds me of last year s No Good Deed. In it, a woman helps a man who is on the run. He seems nice enough at first, but ultimately the movie turns into a long chase scene with the plucky damsel in distress ultimately doing in the bad guy. Here, Leah does everything she should do (including calling the police) but Carter keeps coming back. The movie ends with Leah killing Carter with a shotgun. Leah is a pretty good hero. She s smart and resourceful. She doesn t fall into a lump and cry because she doesn t like her situation. She changes her phone number. She calls the police. She asserts herself and gets a restraining order. She learns to shoot a gun. This is a take-charge woman who knows what she wants.

SCOTT: I agree, Greg, that Leah s hero s journey is fairly solid. At first she lacks the ability to take control of her life and survive the threat that Carter represents. With the help of her police mentor, Detective Hansen (Holt McCallany), she learns to become self-sufficient and gains self-confidence in the process. At the beginning of the movie, this is a woman who is vulnerable; by the movie s end, this is a woman you don t want to mess with. She also discovers an important truth: It isn t easy to find and fall in love with the right person, and so when you do, it s best not to let anything come between you and the well-being of that relationship. The supporting characters are limited in size but quite strong. Carter was indeed a wonderful guy on the surface and would have fooled me, too. He s an effective deceptive villain. Dave is a sweet friend and lover to Leah, a strong, silent type. Detective Hansen is a bit stereotypical as the police sergeant who is limited in what he can do to help Leah, but he emerges as an indispensable help to her. Leah s two girlfriends are rather forgettable. But overall, as with the hero s story, we have a solid herd of supporting characters.

GREG: I liked that they gave Carter a bit of backstory to explain his evil ways. You see, Carter was adopted. And he felt abandoned by the fact that his birth parents didn t want him. This avoids the  pure evil  character that we warn about in our book  Reel Heroes & Villains.  You want your villain to have a pain that he succumbs to - as a way of explaining why the villain turned to evil. The Perfect Guy isn t the perfect movie. It isn t the perfect horror. Nor is it the perfect thriller. But it is a good way to pass a couple hours in the dark. The one thing that left me wondering is a scene Leah has with her mother. She asks Mom how she knew Dad was the one. Mom replies that he was persistent - no matter how many times she said no, he still kept on trying. It s a nice little story. But it, too, smacks of stalking. What s the lesson then? I don t think anyone can parse a lesson out of this film which is why I give it a middling score of 3 out of 5 Reels. Leah is a decent hero. As you point out, Scott, she travels a nice arc from being vulnerable to being able to fend for herself. We don t get much backstory for her, though. It is apparently enough that she is a mature woman of thirty-something and naturally wants children. We don t see any negative traits to her, aside from throwing out a perfectly good man just because he isn t ready to procreate. I give Leah just 3 out of 5 Heroes. And our secondary characters are pretty much par for the course. I enjoyed Michael Ealy s Carter character. He was likable and sinister at the same time. The other characters (Detective Hanson, Mom and Dad, the dueling BFFs) were hardly worth writing home about. Not to mention (we almost didn t) the bland next door neighbor who you knew was going to die from the moment you see her on the screen. I was going to give them all just two cast points, but Ealy was great in this film. So I ve incremented their score to 3 out of 5 Cast points.  Movie: Cast: Heroes:

SCOTT: I wouldn t recommend The Perfect Guy to couples who are on their first date or two, or to people who love being surprised by a movie s twists and turns. There are no twists and turns in The Perfect Guy. It s perfectly predictable, but also perfectly innocuous and semi-appealing if you don t mind turning your brain off and basking in seeing someone else have a worse love life than yours. I give this movie 2 Reels out of 5. The hero s journey is quite respectable in showing how Leah transforms from a na ve, dependent woman into a strong, independent force to be reckoned with. There is excellent mentoring from the police detective and friends and allies who assist Leah on her journey. None of this is academy award material, but it s still a decent hero s story. I give Leah 3 Heroes out of 5. The three main supporting characters -- Dave, Carter, and Hansen   do a fine job of helping or opposing Leah. I was shocked that the cat survived this movie, as I was 100% convinced that it would be boiled to death like the bunny in Fatal Attraction. For some reason, Leah never even connected the bland neighbor s death to Carter, which I found to be an odd omission in the film. Overall, these characters earn 3 out of 5 cast points.

"2879",428,"Not the worst WWII movie I've seen. They did a good job with authentic uniforms and weapons for the most part. 

Rourke's part in the film was completely ridiculous. It almost seemed like he showed up on set, wore what he wanted and shot his part. He probably said, ""you want me in your move I'm going to do what I want whether you like it or not"" only explanation I can come up with for him wearing a flippin cowboy hat, and long hair in an otherwise well costumed movie. I'm guessing maybe he and Dolph came as a package deal? He's by far the worst part of the movie...eliminate him and I might have given it 3 stars.

Other than his horrible French accent, Dolph wasnt nearly as bad as some of the roles I've seen him in. Not quite sure why they made him into a legionnaire though. Better option would have been to let him act in his natural voice and just have him be a special forces instructor instead of trying to force him into a French role.

The German officer was a bit over the top as well...GI dog tags, unit patches...I'm just not sure why in a movie looking pretty authentic that they would stray from that with Rourke and the German officer....

Just when you thought Drac's predictable character development has finally passed by and you can stop disliking him for his selfish needs, this out of nowhere villain appears to give the movie a climax, and it all ends with a lame-ass fight scene with overexaggerated animation that makes the action more stilted than engaging.",2

"2900",449,"99 Homes tackles increasingly relevant yet to some degree historic themes in a splendid, mostly realistic examination of the seedy side of capitalism and the trials of those consigned to roles at the bottom of the United States society. Some of the drama appears overwrought and the character arc of Garfield's protagonist quite predictable, but his work along with fellow headliners Dern and Shannon do the business. I also want to mention the minor actors in the film, as every line seemed weighted and directed to perfection despite the film's small scale and the actors' small parts. Moral decay and critiques of the government and society are all too common in Hollywood, ironically from those feeding from the top, but 99 Homes never loses its genuine tone of fury mixed with a surprising understanding and sympathy for those acting as cogs in the brutal business machine throughout a screenplay that combines a thoughtfulness with the necessary brashness and ignorance of the culture.",4

Until we are the ones that are evicted on a conclusive ending. As fast as the movie started, it stopped. There was much more that could have been portrayed and resolved from the character of Dennis Nash and the outcome of his business with Rick Carver.

Really great film with phenomenal performances from the three main stars.",4
"2904",453,"Sollte jeder mal gesehen haben vor allem Menschen in der sozialen Branche.",5
"2905",454,"99 Homes is a solid drama with a base plot about the after effects of the housing boon ending abruptly and the recent economic recession costing thousands of people their family homes. The banking system and real estate brokers act together to foreclose on homes when mortgage payments get too far behind, loans are defaulted on. But the film is actually the people who are affected most by these actions and how drastically it can change them.
Michael Shannon gives his usual brilliant performance, here as a real estate broker who sees all those who he takes advantage of or work for him as beneath him; something to be used for his great financial and egotistical gains. Andrew Garfield is his equal here as Dennis Nash, one of those thousands who lost their source of income when the housing market crashed, and so he lost his family home as well. He then gets a chance to get it back, but it means subjugating, debasing himself and his moral compass (also very much a class-based sense of self) by working for broker Carver. Now he is the one giving the tragic news to now former home owners. Just how far can he submerge his true self in this for that home and tremendous monetary gain in the face of the outright suffering it brings all these people who are very much just like him? We see him later at Carver's party at this swank house with beautiful people, including one on his arm to go with Carver's giggly 'sweetheart' he cheats on his own wife with.
Great work from director Ramin Bahrani and co-writer Naderi on a lean, focused movie with consistent strong tone that keeps you locked  into the moral struggle at work here. We see decent hardworking people turned into shells of their formers selves; from withering figures to violent, raving hostiles. There's a final act that works so well and is essential to Nash's ultimate decision on which path to take which in less skilled, confident hands could well have been one of porous melodrama. 3.7 stars",4

At the same time it was the only gay bar in New York where dancing was allowed.

In this period, little was allowed to gays in USA: in the years immediately after the Second World War, thousands of people lost their jobs in the military and government for suspicion of being gay.

Police made constant raids on gay bars, the customers were arrested, their pictures published in the newspapers.

This period also witnessed a rise of progressive and liberation movements which marked the 1960s, and it was only a question of when this enormous suffering, discontent and discrimination of the gay community will spill over into the fight for equal rights.

"2923",472,"(from The Watermark 11/23/96)
A semi-fictional story about the famous 1969 riots which helped begin the modern gay movement,  is both thought-provoking and entertaining. A young gay midwesterner moves to Greenwich Village to be free to express his sexuality. But all he finds is a plethora of gay clubs that are constantly terrorized and raided by the police. He becomes romantically involved with a drag queen, and joins a political committee which is forming to promote equal rights for homosexuals. The organization has strict rules about conservative appearance and visibility which make him feel he must turn away from his bangled boyfriend if he wants to pursue The Cause. It is a familiar love story that puts a nice personal spin on an important piece of our history. It then adds a cute dimension of fun by punctuating the plot points with drag queens lip-synching obscure 1960's girl tunes. Not only does it stand as dramatic documentation of how far our movement has come,  is also an eye-opening reminder of how much farther we need to go, and how we will never achieve our goals without unifying our own community.",5

This is a film about the ugly side of addiction, in this case gambling.  The film succeeds thanks to strong performances from the leads and some clever dialogue by writers and directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.

It seems a lot of the negative reviewers have a lack of appreciation for cinema and ventured out of their normal genre. This is a slow burn drama with multiple, very large kicks throughout.

The A-list cast does very well too, with familiar faces constantly appearing even after you thought that they'd included enough. The ending is a bit predictable, however, and the story at the end is pretty generic. However, this is quickly overshadowed by all the great things about this film.

The film at times may be light on content, but it does paint a vague portrait of Steve Jobs and gives you enough insight into the man and his legacy. For its short run time of 60 minutes, One Last Thing is a pretty good effort and manages to be entertaining, but at times it could have been better as well. However, the film is well worth seeing if you're interested in the subject and it works quite well for what it tries to accomplish. Apple computers are one of the most financially successful companies and Steve Jobs created something unique and this short gives an insight into his story. Although not truly in depth, the documentary manages to give you enough facts to know more about jobs and his contribution to the tech industry. For what it is, it manages to tell an impressive and interesting story about the man who changed the way we do things, and if you're looking to know about Steve Jobs, this is quite entertaining for what it is, but at the same time a more thorough documentary about Steve Jobs would be great.

I think it is weird to make documentary films out of interviews unless that movie talks about that certain thing, but if it's just a regular interview with the interviewer asking questions to Steve Jobs and he answered, it doesn't really work and felt like it should've been free. But with that said, it is a great interview movie. The ways in detail that Steve Jobs say, makes you interested in this guy. There might be some parts where I wasn't that interested, but Steve Jobs still does kept me interested in what he say till the end.

The performances are good, but not perfect. Guillermo Del Toro made his seal in a classic mystery movie adapting it for a new generation, but I think that it wasn't the better way to do it. The script is round and complete, nevertheless is quiet weird, sometimes it feels like a family film and suddenly it shows rather disturbing scenes.

It has a bit of an identity crisis but comes together in the end due to a coherent aesthetic and consistent tone. Recommended for a rainy day movie.",3
"2991",540,"Lots of hype and some great actors but not much of a pay off",3
"2992",541,"An intriguing tale of Gothic romance and mystery.

Director Guillermo Del Toro's Gothic romance horror mystery Crimson Peak (2015) is always rewarding to revisit with Del Toro's haunting atmosphere and gorgeous visuals. I was enthralled by his dark sensibilities for his enigmatic mystery. Crimson Peak is stylishly directed by Guillermo, but not his best work as it could be less predictable and more chilling. It isolates and astonishes me all the same. It's quite the horrific tale of betrayal and manipulation with a toxic romance.

I do think Guillermo Del Toro's writing has some flaws like the balcony fall not killing the victim or numerous stab wounds seeming paltry in wounding effect. I like how Matthew Robbins and Guillermo Del Toro's ghost story combines several Gothic tales into one fearsome film. Del Toro takes the incest plotline from Cruel Intentions, the bleak Gothic wilderness of Wuthering Heights, the unending lies of Gaslight, the controlling relationship of Rebecca, and the sincere tragic romance of Jane Eyre for his version of a Gothic period drama. 

I wish much of the impressive CGI were practical effects like Guillermo's classic pictures. But, Guillermo's Gothic direction is so engaging and his slow burn pacing affects your senses, that Crimson Peak keeps you interested for 119 minutes. Editor Bernat Vilaplana's quick horror cuts are startling, while his moodier editing pace keeps Crimson Peak crawling towards its bloody conclusion. Crimson Peak is underrated and underappreciated for its compelling visual flair.

Mia Wasikowska is heartfelt and gentle as the curious heroine. Jessica Chastain is frightening as the clearly deranged and ulterior motivated sister and lady of the house. Her fearsome supporting performance is commanding and chilling to witness. Tom Hiddleston is both charming and creepy as a suave gentleman with money on his mind. Charlie Hunnam gets back into his Nicolas Nickleby mode as the handsome doctor and friend to Mia Wasikowska. Jim Beaver has gravitas as a controlling and concerned father. Burn Gorman's shifty private detective seems as sinister as Jessica Chastain. Leslie Hope is so snide and cruel with her every word. Jonathan Hyde was nice to see again with his quaint character. Doug Jones is freaky as the shocking ghosts.

Dan Laustsen's cinematography looks amazing with these eerie wide shots of the red clay that looks like blood red guts. Laustsen's close-ups are peerless and classic cinema in appearance. Thomas E. Sanders' production design builds a decrepit manor that is run down to holes in the ceiling and crimson clay leaking in from the floorboards. Brandt Gordon's art direction creates scary ghost designs and beautiful Gothic aesthetics for Crimson Peak. All the set decorators create a realistic and heightened Gothic world like the visual effects artists with their realistically gory CGI.

Composer Fernando Velázquez writes a beautiful symphony that fits Crimson Peak's ravishing music. His score wraps Crimson Peak in wondrous romance and Gothic tragedy. Costume designers Kate Hawley, Cori Burchell, and Erin Daprato weave all of Gothic history with love into these splendid dresses. I loved the vivid colors and haunting designs choices. Make-up artists Jordan Samuel, Linda Dowds, Mario Cacioppo, Montse Ribé, and Krista Burbidge did phenomenal work with the visual aesthetics of each character's pale look.

In all, Crimson Peak is better than I remembered, but not without its unfortunate flaws. Mia Wasikowska and Jessica Chastain's performances as actresses are magnificently captivating.",4

"3005",554,""""" is the true story of one of the first high schools in Alabama to become integrated.  This initially caused a lot of friction, especially among the football players who did not want black players on their team.  In an effort to stop the fighting, a local evangelist makes a request to speak to the  football team and the coach reluctantly agrees.  After an hour long talk the evangelist, Hank, is able to convert the entire team into followers of Jesus.  At this time in the early seventies, what was known as the Jesus Movement was in full swing and this is a grand example of that movement's power.  The evangelist, Hank, continues to mentor the team with Bible studies after practice and the black and white players work together to turn in an unexpected winning season.  One black player, Tony Nathan, who is an amazing talent, turns out to be the star and is courted by legendary university of Alabama coach Bear Bryant.  The following season starts with a summer practice that includes the cross-town rival team and all the members of that team end up being converted to followers of Jesus as well.  In the end, the  coach is threatened with termination if he continues to pray with his team before games but in the play-off game with the cross-town rivals who are also believers, they recite the Lord's Prayer with the entire stadium in defiance of the school board.  Tony Nathan goes on to play for the University of Alabama and the  High School coach ends up selling insurance; however, before the credits roll it is revealed he later returns to coaching.

This is a story well told.  For believers, this is a joyous celebration of what God can do: The whole team is converted, they then have a winning season, a star player is born, the bitter cross town rivalry is dissolved into respectful sportsman-like play - all because of Jesus. If I didn't know it to be a true story I would say it's too contrived - but it's apparently all true. Keep in mind this is a story about football; so if you're not a football fan it might not be for you.  Ultimately, this is a story about God working in the lives of a group of young people and how that empowerment changes a community.  Overall, I think most followers of Jesus Christ will find this story inspiring.",4

"3007",556,"Pretty good stuff here. I love Sarsgaard anyway, and he fits this role really well. I'm not at all surprised with the reactions Milgram's work got. People really like to think the best of themselves and others, except, of course, for those they want to think little of, or even the worst of. Oh, but not themselves (though I'm clearly leaving out those with abysmal self-image). 
Gaffigan was fairly Gaffigan, but he got the job done. Leguizamo has a nice cameo as one of the study subjects. Edwards and Yelchin are fine in the same position. Dennis Haysbert makes a good Ossie Davis, though it is kinda funny. But Lutz is a lousy Shatner. Speaking of Shatner, Betty White just.....And no, that's not Daryl Hannah but the long lost Lori Singer. Ryder was disappointing for me. Seemed to phone this one in. 
I generally dislike the whole obvious breaking the fourth wall, talking straight to the audience thing. Seems contrived, cheesy, hammy often. But I can see how it can be used for exposition, and can be a way of bringing in comedy, too. But I think here director Almereyda was going for a theater stage context, which works with the hand-drawn type backdrops that are used at times.
I wonder if the 'playfulness', as some reviewers call it, is there to offset the disturbing experiment results, the Eichmann/Nazi/Pogrom material. It does detract from the film, imo. Let it be what it is.
Very heavy, heady subject matter here, and it was handled well in a film context. And yes, I got the elephant in the room. 3 stars",3

"3009",558,"The first 30 minutes of the film is about all you need. After that, it gets real old, real fast. The experiment is not that hard to understand. After that the film becomes more about Milgram who isn't that interesting. Often encounters are patched into the film that simply add running time but add nothing to the film. And the documentary approach becomes quite boring after awhile. I barely paid attention over the last 45 minutes. Neither the film or Milgrahm's experiment add much to human understanding and insight. Why so many praise the film is beyond me.",3

A character study on Milgram isn't the case nor does it explore anything more intricate about how the experiments affect our understanding of the world. Also, the marriage between him and his wife lacks any sort of turmoil that I think it was trying to build, which makes the final 5 minutes completely unearned.",2

There was a female Pashtun contestant in the finale of the third season of Afghan Star, and Setara Hussainzeda, to whom the movie was dedicated,  was a female performer eliminated in an earlier round who received death threats for dancing.  The mixture of goofy and deadly was somewhat odd, but it didn't ruin the movie for me. In addition to the characters and acting I also enjoyed the music.

It does a fantastic job of making the memory flashes throughout the movie a way to keep the plot moving at a fast pace, instead of being either useless or an irritating interruption of the plot. It stayed on track, was easy to follow, and gives the viewers both: a guess of what the characters consider a happy ending, and enough questions and dangers to hope for a sequel. I loved every minute of the movie, it held my attention from start to finish.",5

This series started out as rough, tough, cargasm movies, but it has gradually morphed via James Bond/Mission Impossible car-based action movies into, at this point, super-hero movies – Vin Diesel and Jason Statham both display levels of invulnerability which Superman would be proud of. If you thought the 25 mile airport runway in episode 6 was stretching things a bit, wait until you see what happens with the red car in this one. The action is absolutely preposterous, and highly entertaining, even if none of it makes any sense at all (the government seriously has no operatives that can do this kind of thing, so they have to recruit a bunch of freelance drivers to bale out of a cargo plane in their cars? Really?).

Underwriting the whole thing is the knowledge of Paul Walker's death during production, necessitating rewriting and a variety of tricks to bring his character into scenes not filmed at that point. On the whole, this has been fairly well done, and there is little in the way of clunky moments when Walker's absence is obvious, which just leaves the awareness of his death and how that might impact on the story. Credit to the cast and crew for allowing the character to exit the series in a dignified and pleasing way, and for adding a moving coda by way of tribute which is dramatically fitting, thematically appropriate to the character and the saga, and full of obvious love for their lost friend and brother.",4

It is a pile on of over the top scene and the most genuine pretenses in making the characters seem cool. It's all dumb but it's fun and you know what you're getting into, if you're watching the 7th part of this series. I'm sad, that they benched Johnson for better part of the movie. What elevates this part above all others is the famed tribute to Paul Walker. It's tasteful and heartfelt. At the same time it fits the series so well, that you can not really imagine a better send off they could have given him.",3

I've met many tech and non tech types like him. The direction, script, production design, score and much more all work brilliantly; and the disciplined running time is a refreshing strength.

This kind of thing always has terrified me, and Ex Machina is one to keep you thinking for sure.

"3073",622,"The Longest Ride is a film based on a couple who falls in love, even with their differences. Luke is a bull rider who is looking to make a comeback after an injury. Sophia is an art major who is deeply inspired about art. Luke and Sophia meet at a bull riding show, and they instantly hit it off when they saw each other later that night. One night they saved an elderly man named Ira, an art collector, who would change both of Luke and Sophia's lives. This film had many sweet moments, while still keeping it entertaining. One thing I thoroughly enjoyed was the flashbacks incorporated throughout the film. Ira talked about his wife and how they were able to make their relationship work so well. They showed these moments through flashbacks, and related them to Luke and Sophia's relationship. Ira talked so passionately about his wife, and it was so nice to see the similarities between their love stories. They came from very different generations, but the way they were related was fun to watch. The flashbacks also gave the audience something to relate to through the different generations. Couples watching could easily see how love is the same throughout so many generations and time periods. The audience could also relate those flashbacks to their parents or grandparents. I really enjoyed how it gave the audience something to relate to. Another thing that I really enjoy about this film is how it shows that each person in the relationship has different passions. Luke's passion is bull riding, and Sophia's passion is art. These differences may cause rough patches in relationships, but this film is a great example of how to not let that happen. I really like how Luke fully supports Sophia's dreams. Many times we see the woman just following her partners dreams, rather than her own. Luke is very supportive and this is such a good characteristic of a healthy relationship. Sophia is also supportive of Luke and isn't selfish when it comes to her dreams. I think the film does a good job of staying away from certain stereotypes. Lastly, I enjoyed how much this movie had me on the edge of my seat. I would not consider this a boring movie, as I felt entertained the whole time. The flashbacks definitely contributed to this. It was almost as if there were 2 story lines at once. I think it was a really good balance and wasn't overdone. The flashbacks stayed parallel with the main story line throughout the movie. I also was not able to predict what was going to happen. In many films you can often predict what was going to happen next. I was surprised many times throughout the movie. I was most glad that the ending was not what I expected. It totally took a turn and surprised me. My favorite part of the film was the ending because of how unique it was to other love stories. I was entertained throughout the full movie, and I loved the ending. It is definitely worth the watch.",4

Not to be confused with Venice in the title as the Europe's own Venice. It's a place in Los Agenles, USA. I don't know it is to be called a B movie or an indie, but definitely a decent drama with a decent storyline and cast. Indeed, it was about Alex, a middle age working and married woman with a young son. Her husband who takes care of the household, is now deserted them. So in her busy working life, Alex comes to realise the family bonding, particularly with her son. Then there's her dad and sister who are a troublemaker than any useful. So her life with a new perspective begins, like a self-discovery.

This is a directional debut for a supporting actor. He should be directing more films. I really liked it. It was simple and obviously realistic. This thing happens in the real world. So all I felt it was a reflection of someone's real life on the screen. Well written and directed. I liked the cast too. Mary Elizabeth was very good and so the rest of them. This is not an unexpected film, but with its limits it had narrated a fine story. The ratings are not fair. It's surely worth a watch and better than an average.

It was somber to the max, and dreary and painted Communism with about as dark a brush as you could find. The sheer randomness of power, the total arbitrary aspects of government were well displayed. True to history also, Genrik Yagoda was the head of the Secret Police but ended up in front of a firing squad.
The movie is like a historical poem, a dirge using cinematic license to show the incredible dark side of the USSR.

This film is no little miss sunshine, but as someone whose life is ruled by, as Dev Patels character Alex says, and Vincent quotes this so brilliantly, I would would give anything to be free from this, but it doesn't stop, and it's not my fault. This film may be full of cliches, but it is written from a place of truth, a place of understanding. Many people live with things they cannot control, some are extreme illnesses, disabilities, others are simply because they are born in a low socioeconomic neighbourhood, or not born with the right genitalia or skin colour that opens all the doors in the world. Regardless, we have our crucibles and they have the ability to make our world smaller and smaller and we get no say over them. This film celebrates the difference, it jokes about the harsh realities (when you could either cry in despair or make the conscious decision to laugh). The story may be one that has been told a thousand times, just with different characters, and let us be honest these are some great characters, but its heart, its point, its is beautiful, honest and truthful. I recommend this movie to anyone, maybe it will show viewers that we do not know what other people are going through so we should never be quick to judge, never be quick to scorn and instead approach everyone as we wish to be treated, with kindness, empathy and love. Highly recommend (but please make sure if you are underage to have a parent or guardian watch with you).",4
"3124",673,"- The Road Within is a circus train wreck -

The circus train wreck that is The Road Within made me uncomfortable and that's kind of the point. I laughed. I cringed. I wanted to turn away. And yet I kept watching.

Writer/director/actress Gren Wells (A Little Bit of Heaven) tells the story of a group of mental misfits who sneak out from their rehabilitation center and head towards the ocean. However, despite its self-proclaimed coming of age angle, The Road Within felt more like an existential meditation on mental illness in modern society and our inability to cure or remove the associated discomfort. The three main characters, Vincent, Alex and Marie, battle Tourette's, OCD, and anorexia, respectively.

I may be slightly biased about the talent in this film. I've been in love with Robert Sheehan (Misfits, Moonwalkers) since my Misfit marathons in college, and Dev Patel (The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) has proved himself a genius actor several lifetimes over since Slumdog Millionaire. The duo are well matched by Zoe Kravitz's (Mad Max: Fury Road, Divergent) choice to embrace the subtly tragic nature of Marie's inability to relinquish control.

I empathized with the characters not because of some logical turns in the plot, but because of these compelling, deeply human performances.

The film opens at the funeral of a mother who drank herself to death; attended by a father politician whose anger issues and narcissism have gone unchecked to the point that he has emotionally disconnected from his son. Even Amy Winehouse, who battled addiction and depression for years before sadly committing suicide, gets a shout-out in a comedic Tourette's filled outburst when Vincent (Sheehan) proclaims ""Amy Winehouse sucks my cock.""

""The Road Within"" is an ensemble circus performed over a backdrop of madness. But the reality of the film is very much akin to the reality of life -- mental illness is pervasive and no one has a real clue what to do about it.

I've watched some of my closest friends and roommates battle bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety. Personally, I've struggled with insomnia. One in ten people in the United States will face an eating disorder in their lifetime, two-thirds of those will be women. Marie's unresolved anorexia is a reminder of the many ways society has gone off the tracks and hasn't yet figured out how to recalibrate.

Vincent best sums up this inability to recalibrate, saying ""there's a clown in my head and he shits in between my thoughts and he forces me to do the most inappropriate thing at the most inappropriate moment. So relaxing is pretty much the one thing I cannot do.""

Relaxing is not something I was able to do watching this film. It was an exercise in empathizing with the more distressed parts of human nature. A very necessary exercise in a world where mental illness is relegated to being the dirty laundry thrown at the bottom of the closet with pills and rehab centers. I shared in the characters' discomfort at the end of the film, particularly because it didn't tie things up in a neat bow. Many of the core issues were simply left unresolved.

Despite several cliché and poorly handled plot metaphors as well as an on-the-nose title, The Road Within is an uncomfortable cinematic journey that I didn't know I needed to take but am glad I did.

It's a beautiful reminder that we are all battling demons, and while we may never slay the beast, we can look into its beady clown eyes from time to time, and say ""Thanks for bearing witness.""

"3125",674,"This movie only further propels the stereotypes about mental illnesses and facilities. Some aspects may even be taken the wrong eay by those supposed to related to the production. Overall, does more harm than good.",1
"3126",675,"A patient with Tourett's syndrome becomes friends with a guy with OCD and a girl suffering from anorexia.  Together they go on a trip that gives them a sense of ""being"" by just enjoying their company and nature.  The acting was very good and you begin to care about the characters going through all their problems.  Though the film has its touching moments, it didn't really draw me in emotionally like other films in this genre.  Overall, this is a GOOD movie.  3/5  OR  6/10",3
"3127",676,"Very dumb movie, nothing clever going on here. I'd recommend watching with friends to make fun of while watching",2
"3128",677,"Clever idea, some good bits. The blender scene was pretty well made. But doesn't stick the landing.",3
"3129",678,"The found footage genre in horror seems to be more of an acquired taste to fans of the horror genre, and I got to say that this movie just doesn't do it enough for me. It starts off strong with a lot of mystery and builds tension well throughout the entire course of the movie until the last scene. However, the deaths of each character were all very underwhelming and most of them felt very rushed, except for the third one which actually added a lot to the stories of the characters in the call and not just Laura's story. I also felt this movie ages itself very poorly and watching it for the first time anytime after 2015 makes it seem ancient, but then again at some points it served as a bit of a nostalgic touch seeing websites like the old YouTube site. Overall, this movie is stuck between being awful and just okay, so I'm going to give it a 2/5. Besides a few moments of tension and some funny moments of teens being idiots, this movie is just a bad execution of an otherwise interesting idea for a horror film.",2
"3130",679,"I was pleasantly surprised with the majority of this movie. This was the first major ""screenlife""-format movie and it makes good use of this gimmick. It translates more traditional eerie (and sometimes outright terrifying) horror tropes to a virtual format very effectively while capturing the essence of the late-2000s creepypasta-style internet horror. In addition, there are also quite a few unique scares that could only happen via a computer screen. 

There are some effective moments of morality regarding cyberbullying and general teenage shittiness, although the movie doesn't really have anything new to say that hasn't been said many times before. The cast is all pretty good, especially the male characters who accurately portray high school boys' ability to act tough and then immediately break down crying when they don't get what they want. The script for the female characters leans a little too heavily into generic ""cat fights"" and he-said-she-said drama for my taste, though.

This film struggles a bit with suspension of disbelief. I found myself distracted when the Skype conversation would abruptly go silent whenever something else was happening on ""our"" screen, which is ironic because I'm certain that decision was made to avoid distraction. Some of the characterizations are a bit loose as well - at one point, a character learns the ""key"" to defeating the enemy, only to conveniently ignore that information for the sake of a reveal at the end of the film.

I would have loved to have given this 4 stars, but there's a stupid, obnoxious jump scare stinger just before the credits start. I hate those, and so does everyone else. And the worst part is that this film didn't even need it - it had plenty of scares, both slow and abrupt. So that pissed me off. But up until that point, this was a 4-star film with fresh ideas, dark and interesting themes, and some excellent gore.",4
"3131",680," is a horror movie with a fresh new take. With the entire movie being inside of a laptop, the writers and director are all challenging themselves to bring a good movie to the table.

At a lot of points they got it right, but unfortunately they missed the mark on crucial points.

"3134",683,"With a fresh idea that manages to squash usual Horror film cliches,  becomes repetitive at times with dumb character decisions here and there but that can't camouflage the strong acting, stunning narrative and a talented use of sound effects and suspenseful cinematography making  scarier than I expected.",4
"3135",684,", from academic and filmmaking standpoints, is actually pretty interesting because other than literally the final second of the movie, the entire thing takes place on a computer screen, making it really unique and unlike anything I'd ever seen before.  has college level concepts in it that make it worth watching despite its flaws and manages to exploit and add anxiety to things that commonly happen on computers that we don't normally make a big deal about. These things happen frequently and they mean nothing to us, but they mean a lot to the characters in this movie and heighten the fear and horror despite how relatively minor they are. The structure of this movie will be very familiar to teens and young adults in the era of modern technology which gives it a sense of relatability that I did appreciate. The way the characters react to each other and the horror component of this movie is extremely realistic and accurate of how people would react in the real world, as is the way they respond to it. They take appropriate actions to attempt to deal with the horror part of this movie, something I also liked. In general,  doesn't rely on protagonist curiosity/stupidity to further along the plot or make the movie go in a totally new direction; the characters try to be as smart as they can be to resolve the conflicts in the movie, even if some of those resolutions aren't too pretty. The horror itself isn't bad; the movie (spoiler alert) manages to make a glitch of someone staring at a camera frozen really scary and probably the most terrifying moment of the whole movie. A lot of the horror in this movie is stupid, but that shot wasn't and was effective. Unfortunately,  suffers from a lot of story and plot stupidity and important things not making sense. There were other ways this movie could've been executed that would been much better for me and caused the components that didn't make sense to make a lot more sense, which would've helped the film flow better overall. I don't fully understand what was causing the characters to have the fates that they did since my understanding was that the supernatural presence was limited to the computer screen, and yet many scenes in the movie suggest otherwise. The core premise of this movie doesn't work too well for me which is disappointing because the structure is really interesting.  got close to being a really enjoyable movie for me and really just suffers from things not making sense and flowing badly which causes it to falter at crucial moments when it could've really shined and been an effective work of art in the horror genre.",2

The first half of this movie tries to be more of a lighthearted comedy, but the jokes didn’t really land for me and it felt a little slow. They could’ve cut out about 15 minutes of the first half.

First, Adaline is a bland, soft spoken, vapid, beige shell of a woman, which is quite  maddening given her length on this earth. They tried showing her intelligence through being multi-lingual and a knack for trivia but somehow it wasn't convincing. The message this movie sends is that the only thing Adaline has going for her is her looks. Thank goodness she doesn't age.

Let's be honest, if Ellis wasn't a good-looking, successful white guy, he would be a creepy psychopath stalker. Making douchey comments about how she should've introduced herself, forcefully not leaving when she had asked him to, and making borderline sexist remarks like ""pink is for girls"". I'm 5 years late to the game, I get it. but in any year, this guy would be a huge red flag.

"3170",719,"A very Scottish film, not always easy to follow the dialect. Similar to Whiskey Galore it's set back in the day when the Scotts were a friendly people. Has some funny moments and could be one of the very few loch and canal versions of a ""road movie"".",3
"3171",720,"The  is one of Ealing Studios finest comedies.  It is director Alexander MacKendrick's take on modern versus traditional views in Scotland after the 2d WW and on American corporate values in Britain.  The interplay is quite interesting, when one considers that MacKendrick was an American who was raised in Scotland and eventually returned to live in the U.S.

One senses a longing on the part of the writer, William Rose, for a vanishing coastal Scotland, and all the values that were incorporated by that rural society.  

The story began as others in Glasgow represented new values and the Captain of the , played by Alex MacKenzie, and his crew encountered problems in this urban atmosphere in which they were so out of play.
 
The lead character, called the American and played Paul Douglas, was an even greater displacement for the crew of the  but could even be seen as pushing along his own employees as he referred to some as being incompetent and one mentioned that when she sought to leave he doubled her salary.  He believed that his modern fixations with time being an obsession and money being of paramount importance were even somewhat much for the Scottish in Glasgow of the early 1950s.

The comedy works because, the American and his employees are forced to adopt to a mode of life in which we can all empathize.  Although the 's captain is a bit of a scoundrel, his purpose is never self profit, it is merely to keep his ship operating.  

The American who is defrauded, and he is without a doubt, has vindictive motives, is overbearing and does not gain any sympathy until he undergoes a series of humiliating experiences, most of which are surprisingly instigated by the cabin boy, who would be the hero if there was one.  

Some comments regarding the cabin boy.  The lad certainly is the catalyst for much of the action that causes the plot to move.  To reveal too much would be inappropriate, however, it suffices to say that the arrest of the assistant, the dock, the washboard and so forth were all at this instigation.  It does make the one weakness in the plot construction as it is a bit too convenient and easy for my taste.  That said, it does work doesn't it.

All in all, a wonderful movie.",5

It includes a memorable scene of a Céilidh (gathering, often with music and dance) that is a genuine rarity in its authenticity. Film lovers may be more familiar with better known classics like Whisky Galore (also directed by Alexander MacKendrick) and Powell & Pressburger's I Know Where I'm Going, but The  is not to be dismissed.

The music is sometimes alright but not enough to prop up the half of the film or more spent in some of the most cliched performances and scripting that I have ever seen put into practice. The romances are all obscenely underdeveloped, dull, and unnatural. No performance suggests a hint of chemistry with the rest of the cast. Anna Kendrick has had serious dramatic roles to mixed effect but this must have set her progress back. Hailee Steinfeld fits into the same category. Rebel Wilson's character is obnoxious and her entire character one massive fat joke that was not funny to begin with. As a throwaway, casual flick, perhaps one could do worse and the badness of proceedings can provide an encouraging familiarity, but Pitch Perfect 2 is as reprehensible as films can become and falls apart every time the characters step off of the stage.",2

I wouldn't say it's anything bad, but even soon after viewing I am struggling to remember any good moments from it. I found the cast and music to be the big plus points to 'Pitch Perfect', though both of those things are off in this follow-up.

Anna Kendrick (Beca) doesn't really do anything, at least very little that's even close to being memorable. Skylar Astin (Jesse) takes a back seat, which I don't actually think is a negative. Adam Devine (Bumper) and Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) aren't as amusing, though the story featuring those two probably did interest me most. Hailee Steinfeld, meanwhile, is an alright addition.

The characters are also done very well (minus a couple of them) and are presented in a very likeable way. The issue that I have is that it just feels too by-the-books and predictable, where just about every trope that you can imagine being used in a horror film is used.

"3221",770,"The story behind this film is both inspiring and unbelievable. Arielle Holmes was a homeless New York crack addict in her early twenties. Shortly after her recovery, while she was an intern at a New York jewel shop, the Safdie brothers discovered her during research for another film (you can probably deduce which one). They advised her to write a memoir. She did so, and they adapted it for the big screen with Holmes herself playing a fictionalized version of herself, not as Arielle but as Harley, a character going through events painfully similar to the real thing, roaming the streets of New York City with other young people lost in the folly of drugs.

You don't get to see this level of authenticity in a film too often. Filming exclusively on location, Josh and Benny Safdie prove with their first somewhat mainstream film that neorealistic blood goes through their veins. With the help of Holmes' excruciatingly real performance, they tell a story of suffering, addiction and toxic relationships (in the most literal sense).

Still, what I find most exceptional in Heaven Knows What and also what makes it a challenging and fascinating exercise in filmmaking is the slightly expressionistic meat on the neorealistic bones, with an eerie soundtrack and some neon-lighted shots that effectivelly transport you right inside Harley's scarred heart. The Safdies would eventually flesh out this side to their directorial personas in the later, excellent Good Time. This is where they demonstrated what visceral filmmakers they are, their unique style pulsating in every shot of their career.",5

At least the weather felt really nice on that warm February night. Walking to a bar. I needed a drink. Listening to Radiohead in my headphones. Music that always help me to move forward from mixed feelings that I can catch every now and then. 

The movie has an intense violence on the sentiments. Everything seems to be on point to truly fuck you up in the head like the characters in the picture. The dirt. The pain. The need. The lost possibilities. Replay again and again. 

The perfect elements put together. A book written by Arielle Holmes. Mad Love in New York. A fiction of her own life in a movie where she plays her story. She's the main character. Ariel Pink is in charge of the music. Putting the mind of the Safdie brothers behind the camera and the result is a unique piece of art. A masterpiece. 

I thought Good Times was out of this world but it has just been over passed by Heaven Knows What. I must watch Uncut Gems and all the other Safdie brothers early work now.

The cinematography techniques used in Me and Earl and The Dying Girl were such simple techniques but used in such a way where it really impacts the film. To show the separation between the two protagonists, Greg and Rachel, the cinematographer employs a simple technique, keep them separated. In the beginning of the relationship when they shared the screen one character was significantly smaller than the other allowing us to see the distance between them. Utilizing a deep focus, both characters can be seen in focus but yet the distance is still there. 

As the film progresses, when the two characters share the screen they appear to be much closer either in a simple two shot or over the shoulders. Once act three happens and the characters are divided we go back to the distance once again.

There's one scene in the film where the two characters are verbally fighting. It's a 5 minute one take of nothing but great performances by the actors. This simple technique allows the audience to choose who they want to listen to. It gives the scene a real theater feel.

It's strangely disjointed and hard to describe. It doesn't really take itself seriously---or if it does, the filmmaker and writer are greatly deluded.
It's another ""new weird guy moves into suburban neighborhood"" movie, which has been done innumerable times. But this time, it's not just the new guy who's weird; it's everybody on the block. One guy has a gambling addiction. The main character (Steven Weber) has OCD, his kid has phobias and neuroses, and his wife has an inexplicable attraction to the new guy, a shady psychiatrist who has lost his license (Eriq LaSalle).
Weirdness abounds, and none of it explained. LaSalle's character drives a 1960's Mercury with big tail fins. Weber's character slowly goes insane and ends up shaving his head. 
When his kid disappears, Weber begins to suspect that LaSalle has kidnaped him. He also suspects that LaSalle is abusing women in his basement. I kept watching just to learn the answer to the mystery, and I have to say I was surprised, even though I should have seen it coming.

Storyline 
In the environment of war torn Germany, we find a young war veteran, Adolf Hitler. He is loaded with humiliation, shame, anger and hatred. As so many other Germans, from that period, he also finds the peace terms of Versailles, humiliating and provocative. They make all their war efforts and sacrifices at the front, useless. 

So Hitler wants respect and he wants revenge. Not only for him, but also for Germany and the German people. As so many other hateful veterans, throughout the bloody history of mankind, Hitler also attempts to find activities, enabling him to let off steam, and make him feel respected. 

And in this movie, destiny pick a Munich art dealer, who happens to be Jewish, helping Hitler out of fear, to figure out what type of activity, will help him the most.

Eventually, Hitler figures out, that Art + Politics = Power. imum Power, naturally.
His lust for power is a narcissistic effort, distancing him from his own dysfunctionality (read: self-hatred).

The movie also portray the young Adolf Hitler, developing in two stages; 
1. from desperation to control behavior 
2. from control to dominance behavior

It is an important movie, to anyone wanting to understand, why humiliation turn into violence. 
I give it Top Rate and thank the entire crew, for making it happen. The humankind need many more movies in this category. They can save lives.

This time around, Ted (the voice of Seth MacFarlane) has married Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) and, in order to save their marriage, have decided to start a family.

En cuanto a la película, me pareció muy divertida y con una trama con un ritmo bastante bueno que además lo acompañan los momentos divertidos. En cuanto a algo malo, me pareció algo forzado lo que hicieron con el personaje de Lori al saber que Mila Kunis no repetiría su papel; sin embargo el personaje de Amanda Seyfried me gustó. Otra cosa mala es la vuelta del personaje de Donny, muy innecesario y forzado para darle algún conflicto a la trama. Por otro lado, las actuaciones me gustaron mucho y en esta secuela suma estrellas importantes en papeles secundarios y terciarios como Morgan Freeman y Liam Neeson, lo cual siempre es muy bueno.

"3302",851,"NOTE: There is no rule banning heterosexual men from seeing these movies simply because their premise is about male strippers. You are free to watch whatever you choose and like what you like. They won't magically turn you gay and even if you do get turned on, just remember, bisexuality exists. It's still an unhealthy prejudiced belief to assume that all bisexuals are just people suffering from ""gay denial""
REVIEW: Magic Mike XXL doesn't have much of a plot - hell, after the big climax at the convention, the movie just ends - compared to its predecessor and seems to ignore what message there was in the first film about the titular character's life being quite empty and deconstruction of that glamorous lifestyle. And yet, I prefer this sequel over the sleeper hit from 2012. Mainly because it fixes certain problems the first movie had by keeping the focus solely on Channing Tatum's character, getting rid of all the orange and getting rid of the terrible sister of The Kid (who doesn't appear in this movie due to Alex Pettyfer clashing with Tatum on set during the first film) who served as a love interest for Mike. Oh, and while I think the stripping sequences are better choreographed in the first film, the ones we see in this movie are still pretty good in their own right, and you don't necessarily have to be aroused to enjoy them. I'm not gay but I did admire the hell of a job the actors did with one moment in the climax concerning mirrors...watch the movie, or at least a clip of it on YouTube, you'll see what I mean. Even without the beefcake that'll get girls and the G & B in LGBT to see this movie, one thing I did like was the camarederie between the cast which I didn't think we got enough of in the first film. Perhaps being a road trip movie coupled with a noticeably more lighthearted tone helped in that regard. Magic Mike XXL isn't seeking to break any new ground, it does it's job and does it well. Whether it be the fanservice or the camarederie, I'm sure you can find something of value in this sequel.",4

I watched this on Disney+, along with other movies made before this, and this film looked like it was filmed on a cheap camera.

"3310",859,"Disney presents another movie about the disabled community. Jenny Agutter stars as  in the 1900s. She leaves her rich socialite life behind from her overbearing lawyer husband and takes a position at a school for children. This school in particular houses the blind and deaf. Many of them come from Appalachian families whom have given up on them having normal lives.
Later she falls in love with a doctor Ben played by Barry Newman. During her teachings she of course faces doubt and opposition of whether or not people with hearing impairments can actually communicate. Plus the school barely has any funds for anything. 
 also has to prove herself to her husband that she wants her own freedom and not be chained to the chambers of his lifestyle. Plus we understand why they both distanced themselves; they had a child but he was born with the same conditions as these kids she's teaching.
It shouldn't matter if someone's capable of having normal children, they still can be loved despite the limitations, just because someone is disabled doesn't mean they should be relegated to their own kind, it's true people don't know how to act around the deaf fearing they won't mix well with others, the only thing that's wrong is to deny how we really feel, everything costs something but only we can know if it's worth it, can a word truly make a difference?
Jenny Agutter is so sensational in this role. She's a great teacher learning to love while also having the kids learning from her. She belongs to herself. Plus it's great that this is another Disney flick that appeals to the handicapped showing they're not impossible to help. We can all learn from each other just by listening rather than simply hearing.",4
"3311",860,"A very sweet film, one with its heart truly in the right place.

I had a fine time watching ''. There's a few very touching moments, alongside a few shocking parts too; one particularly surprised the hell out of me, the most a Disney film has so far in fact. Those come amongst the storyline which entails blind and deaf children, as well as a bit of women's empowerment in there too. They blend it together nicely.

Jenny Agutter is excellent in the titular role, I felt connected to her story whilst also getting the required sense care and charm that her character is intended to have. Otto Rechenberg, one of many deaf/blind people cast, is very good. All the main ones onscreen do a noteworthy job, in fairness.

All the characters here are paper-thin and clichéd, they make stupid decisions to put themselves needlessly in peril.

"3339",888," is relentlessly morose, and it quickly becomes tiresome. 
It's a story of a family that has relocated to a seedy, bleak town in the Australian Outback to escape a sex scandal in their previous town involving their teenage daughter and a teacher. The town looks like something from an old western, even though the story takes place in present  day. 
The parents, Catherine and Matthew Parker (Nicole Kidman and Joseph Fiennes), have their hands full with their sullen prepubescent son Tom (Nicholas Hamilton) and their moody and annoying 15 year old daughter Lilly (Maddison Brown). On top of that, there is a unexplained strain on their relationship that keeps them sleeping separately. Their verbal exchanges are terse and full of resentful subtexts.
Not a happy family, and not a happy movie. It nearly collapses under the weight of its own angst.
The plot involves the kids disappearing in the middle of the night after a nasty dust storm. Lilly has been sexually involved with some of the young local males, and maybe she was kidnaped, but that doesn't explain why Tom is gone, too. Lilly is the kind of kid you would like to slap. She's disrespectful and arrogant, and she spends her free time writing awful poetry (which we are unfortunately subjected to in voice-overs). Tom is angry and laconic. If I were their parent, I'd be glad they disappeared. 
The Parkers enlist the help of the local lawman Rae (Hugo Weaving, playing the closest thing to a likeable character in the entire film). But the procedural aspect of the search is constantly overshadowed by the focus on the miseries of all the characters. Bad marriage, depression, regret, repressed anger….I kept patiently enduring all of the melodrama just to find out what happened to the kids. By the halfway point, I was getting restless---and the movie is a full two hours.
We eventually discover that Lilly has apparently inherited her promiscuity from her mother, who ends up trying to seduce one of Lilly's boyfriends---while her daughter is missing?!! I guess that explains the marital problems. And I'm sad to say, things get even more absurd.
As to the denouement: There is none. Sorry for anybody who expected one. But at least we spent two hours feeling dismal.",1

Slow down!"" and he was like ""It's okay, we're f'ing!""...No. You should always be able to reverse the roles in sexual scenarios and have them still be consensual. There are ways to draw out a sexually aggressive character without doing this.

Plus, there was a shooting at a theatre during this film's showing, and now Hollywood's like ""Time for a sequel!"". No. Take the warnings from the universe.

I will check out her new TV series when it comes out, and since it's on Hulu, she can feel safe in knowing that all of us trolls go where it's open season at throwing rotten tomatoes at the actors heads like we did at Medieval Days, as there are still some sites that won't censor public opinion.

"3384",933,"A No Heavy Tearjerker, But Still Searingly Relatable and Sentimental
Coming on the heels of its commercially-successful predecessor, 'The Fault in Our Stars', PAPER TOWNS is no heavy tearjerker, but it echoes more affectionate and piercing sentiments, with its lighter, minimalist take of its recognizable subjects.

The film follows Quentin (Nat Wolff) , or ""Q"" as he is more popularly called, a highschool boy who has been nursing an unrequited love for the girl living next door, Margo (Cara Delevigne) since childhood. Even after when they turn 12, when Margo suddenly becomes distant, ""Q"" never loses the affection, and it only becomes even stronger when one day she climbs again to his window, the way she did when they were still kids. The next events follow an eager ""Q"" savoring the moment as he escorts Margo in her series of ""small revenge"" against those she thinks have betrayed her, including her ex-boyfriend. But the levitating moment would only last overnight, because the next day, the ever mystifying Margo, disappears.

Mining on the same overly familiar material that dwells on both coming-of-age and teenage romance territories, PAPER TOWNS pulls off two easily-recognizable efforts: maintaining 'The Fault's charm, while toning down its tragic notions. The latter of which, yields a more tangible and heartwarming result, capable of conjuring a lasting tug at the heartstrings. The credit for this goes to its equally-charming yet capable actors, both of whom teeming with fresh and enigmatic likability. It will also sound unforgivable to never pay regard to the film's brilliant screenwriters who manage to cleverly highlight this extremely familiar highschool tale's stronger and more relatable sentiments, genuinely and sincerely enough, to bend fragile emotions with crippling capacity.

""Q""'s road trip in finding Margo represents a bigger journey with far wider scope and meaning, and it comes across as a process of personal exploration that unknowingly liberates one self, toward finding the deeper sense of their existence. Hardly that the questions thrown get resolved, but the charming and sincere take of its proceedings, will ultimately make the narrative arrive to a satisfying conclusion. This doesn't mean it's able to satisfy its own queries, but the resolution delivered are nonetheless, reliable and honest.

PAPER TOWNS will come across as a witty, yet touching case of a 'lost and found'. Much of it is spent in searching for the 'lost', a liberating process that frees its seekers from every question that unfolds in the wake of a previous other, but the 'found', though never really answers any of the previous questions, will deliver a surprisingly satisfying, and never less of a rewarding, answer.",5

And then she disappears and they go on this adventure to find her and once they find her she's all like I was just sending those clues to tell you I was fine which is so ridiculously stupid that it's frustrating.

In what might be the dumbest way someone gets possessed (and eventually becomes the anti-Christ) in any exorcism movie I've ever seen — and I've seen a lot of exorcism movies — Angela (Olivia Taylor Dudley) becomes host to the Lord of Darkness after slicing her finger while cutting her birthday cake and receiving a serum in the hospital; I don't remember which malpractice tort ""causes patient to become possessed"" falls under from law school. I was surprised because The Vatican Tapes actually starts with a pretty cool opening montage and then shows us Djimon Hounsou as Vicar Imani paired with Peter Andersson and his un-placeable Northern European accent as Cardinal Bruun. You'd expect these two, who are watching recordings of obviously possessed American, Angela, from Rome to jet-set to the States and start kicking some demonic ass. Well, you'd be wrong. Instead, these two aren't seen for quite some time and instead, we see the weird story of Angela, boyfriend, Pete (John Patrick Amedori), and Dad (Dougray Scott), cope with her possession in awkwardly acted and paced scenes. When it's time to finally bring in the calvary (religious pun FTW), we only get Bruun, who delivers one of the dumbest lines I've ever heard in an exorcism movie: ""Sometimes, we must move away from God."" … Excuse me? You're a priest, performing an exorcism, and you don't want the help of Jesus Christ?? **Spoiler Alert** the exorcism lasts like 7 minutes, it fails, Angela is the literal anti-Christ, etc. etc. etc. Some moments were okay (dislocating joints while in restraints, pretty standard), others were just weird (spitting up 3 eggs, which forms the Holy Trinity??), and Djimon is in one more scene towards the end just to make the viewer feel like they weren't completely swindled.

Mental illness has its own stigmas without religious mysticism  continuing to muddy the waters. This is a soggy piece of white bread sandwich someone left on the counter. The narrative is a flavorless smear at differentiating magic from mental health while mashing them together at the same time. There are some nice performances - but the performances are at their best with exposition monologues.

Never in a million years could I picture her as a rock star, but she makes it work. Her singing? Well, it's not good but it's not bad either. And the fact that Rick Springfield played her boyfriend was a nice bonus. He's still an amazing musician, decades after ""Jessie's Girl"". I hated the character of Meryl's daughter. Just an awful, hateful person. Granted she had good reason for her bitterness, but it was a little much. On the flip side, I really liked Kevin Kline as the ex-husband and I liked the men who played her sons. This movie is not a comedy at all, and there were very rare laughable moments. I'm glad I watched the whole thing because the ending made up for any shortcomings of the movie.

"3408",957,"GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, don t lose that number, it s time to review Ricki and the Flash.

SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Ricki has some splainin to do. Let s recap.

GREG: We re introduced to Ricki Rendazzo (Meryl Streep), an aging rocker working bars and honky tonks and playing songs from the classic age of rock and roll - with an occasional diversion into Pink. She s barely making ends meet between her gigs and clerking at the grocery store, when she gets a call from her ex-husband that their 20-something daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer) has attempted suicide.

SCOTT: Ricki scrapes up enough money to fly to Indianapolis to give her daughter Julie some emotional support. She s too poor to stay at a hotel and so she stays with her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline) who lives in a mansion with his current wife Maureen (Audra McDonald). Ricki must deal with Julie s resentment toward her, and the awkwardness of her visit is compounded by the arrival of her other two children and Maureen herself.

GREG: Scott, there s nothing really interesting about this story. Unless you are a fan of Meryl Streep. As usual, she gives a great performance. She reminds me of Bonnie Raitt from the 90 s. Frankly, I thought she sauntered through this role. It didn t look like much of a stretch for her. On the other hand, Streep s own daughter plays the role of Julie. Gummer does a passable job as the spoiled and distraught daughter. Ricki brings a certain chaos to Pete s life which is otherwise quite bland. And it looks as though that chaos is what attracted Pete to Ricki in the first place. The story goes through the usual paces with Ricki telling her daughter to skip therapy and take a spa day. There s also a run-in with the new wife who held the family together in Ricki s absence. And then there s the bisexual son who is really gay but never told Ricki. It s all very run of the mill without a lot of real conflict. Just situations where conflict might exist.

SCOTT: It s a good story, Greg. The problem is that everything that happens is too predictable and too saccharine. Ricki starts out estranged from just about everyone -- her band member Greg (Rick Springfield), her ex-husband, all her children. Because shes not a bad person, we know that by the end of the story she ll have bonded with everyone. The question then becomes how does Ricki s life change. What we find is that the transformation of all these relationships occurs in unsurprising ways. In-between all these predictable events we re treated to a lot, and I do mean a lot, of Meryl Streep belting out 70s rock tunes. She does an amazing job, but what we really have here is a 45-minute movie with a 90-minute playing time.

GREG: As a hero, Ricki is very flawed. She is insensitive to her boyfriend - refusing to admit she  loves  him or that they are dating. She left her children to be a rock star - a goal that never materialized. She apparently spent little time with her kids as they grew up - letting another woman raise them. It s only her relaxed lifestyle and clear affection for her children that redeems her to us. And it s enough to allow us to sympathize with her and root for her to do well.

SCOTT: It s interesting that we never see Ricki behave poorly as a wife to Pete or as a mother to her three children. We only see her as a sympathetic figure, a woman trying to atone for her past mistakes and who ends up doing a fine job with her redemption. It s nice that everyone ends up forgiving her, accepting her, and loving her in the end, but this resolution seems unrealistic. And maybe thats the point -- we dont ever see dysfunctional families doing a big group hug at the end, but we sure would like to. The supporting cast does a workmanlike job in this film. Rick Springfield surprised me with his acting chops. Pete and the kids are pretty much stock characters who make our hero s life difficult for a while, but they soften in the end, much like Ricki has softened. Perhaps  soft  is the key term here -- this movie is soft in many, not very flattering ways. Like you said, Greg, Streep shows off her vast talents here, but this film is nevertheless a light, fluffy, made-for-TV movie.

GREG: I liked the second wife in this movie - Maureen. She s a strong woman who stepped into the hole that Ricki left. It s an interesting dynamic between Maureen and Ricki. There s a sense that Maureen successfully eased Ricki out of her children s lives. Then, when Ricki returns to California, Maureen has a change of heart and invites Ricki to her son s wedding. Or was it a change of heart? Was Maureen aware that Ricki wouldn t have the funds to fly back? Regardless, it is her boyfriend Greg who sells his Stratocaster so that Ricki can attend the wedding. And that raises a question for me about secondary heroes. Greg is a secondary character, but he is a sort of martyr. He gives up something of great value to him, so that the hero of the story can have something she wants. He s an enabler of sorts - or in the lexicon of our book  Reel Heroes and Villains  - a catalyst for Ricki s change.

SCOTT: Ricki and the Flash is a pleasant movie about an aging mom who was once a bad mother and is now given a chance to redeem herself. This theme is a common one in today s movies -- witness films such as 3 Days To Kill, Snitch, and A Good Day To Die Hard. The baby-boomer generation is apparently desperate to make amends to the younger generation for its self-indulgent ways. Ricki isn t a bad movie but I won t be giving it a second look. The film deserves about 2 Reels out of 5. Our hero Ricki is on a journey of redemption. She has no mentors, really, and on her own she relies on kindness, loyalty, and patience to win the hearts of her grown children. Perhaps these are the missing qualities that Ricki needed to achieve her redemption, but we are given no insight into how she acquired them. The hero journey is thus a bit stunted. I award Ricki 2 Heroes out of 5. The supporting characters are adequate but unmemorable. When I think back to this movie, all I ll really remember is Streep s excellent performance as Ricki and as a rock n roll wanna-be star. Generously I ll award the supporting characters 2 rating points out of 5.  Movie: Cast:  Heroes:

GREG: Agreed on all counts, Scott. Ricki and the Flash is merely a vehicle for Streep s daughter, Gummer, to have a bit of the spotlight. Perhaps art imitates life as Streep gives something back to her own daughter. We ve seen this in other films like Will and Jaden Smith in The Pursuit of Happyness (2006) and again in Beyond Earth (2013). Movie history is rife with nepotism. I give Ricki and the Flash just 2 out of 5 Reels. The hero story is pretty simple. Ricki does go through a transformation in that she reconnects with her children. And she realizes that she loves her boyfriend Greg and has to accept him as her lover or lose him. She has been pushing people away her whole life and finally realizes she has to be less selfish. I give her 3 out of 5 Heroes. The secondary characters are pretty boilerplate, two-dimensional cutouts. The husband is a bland businessman, the second wife is heartless, the kids are a selection of Lifetime tropes (depressed daughter, yuppie son, and gay son). The character I liked most was Greg the boyfriend because it is his sacrifice that tilts the scales and catalyzes Ricki into the transformation she needs. And he has a likable name. I give the supporting cast 2 out of 5 Cast points. Movie: Cast: Heroes:",2

"3431",980,"Beautiful, thoughtful, quiet, poignant, and true.
This film is excellent. Top-notch writing, entirely driven by strong characterization without contrivances. The acting is excellent, and the dialogue is believable, natural, and honest. This is not your average romcom, and it might not even qualify as a romcom at all, because although it asks many of the kinds of questions that romcoms try to ask, it answers them with far more maturity than most do. This story has themes that resonate and an ending that delivers. There are moments of the transcendent alongside moments of the awkward, and that gives the experience a ring of realism. The personal mysteries are revealed at a good pace, and the story never becomes saccharine, boring, or entirely predictable. I appreciated the good use of silence. I was occasionally annoyed by the unnecessary shakiness of the hand-held camera or the blurry focus of foreground objects, but that only happened a couple of times. This is otherwise a beautiful, thoughtful, quiet, poignant, and true character piece, and it's well worth the watching.",5

"3446",995,"SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, it s a perfect time to review this next movie.

GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Yes, it s Fatal Attraction for a new generation. Lets recap.

SCOTT: Thirty-six-year-old Leah (Sanaa Lathan) and her boyfriend Dave (Morris Chestnut) are having relationship woes. She can feel her biological clock ticking away, and she wants to have a family. But Dave doesn t. The issue is a dealbreaker for her, so she dumps him. Now Leah is back in the dating world, trying to get over Dave and move on with her life...

GREG:   when she meets Carter (Michael Ealy) - a very nice guy who brings flowers to her mother and Giants tickets to her father. He ingratiates himself to Leah, her family, and her best friends. But one night while getting gas, Carter get jealous when a man is admiring his car - which Carter mistook for unwelcome admiration of Leah. Carter beats the living tar out of the man. Leah tells him she never wants to see him again, but Carter begins stalking her. Leah appeals to the police but their hands are tied. Now it s a game of cat and mouse as Carter advances, and Leah retreats.

SCOTT: Greg, by calling itself The Perfect Guy, this movie gives away its premise, namely, that some poor woman is going to fall for a guy who seems too good to be true -- and is. So right off the bat, we know exactly what will happen, but we don t know how it will happen. The strength of the movie lies in its execution: Are the characters interesting, do they have depth, do they grow or change in any significant way, does the hero captivate us, etc. In short, can this movie overcome its self-inflicted predictability? Sadly, the answer to all these questions is  not so much . To be sure, this is a movie that is hard to dislike, thanks in large part to the sweet girl-next-door appeal of our hero Leah, who has a good heart and rotten luck with men. Her first beau, Dave, isn t a bad guy at all; he just isn t ready for children. We can t even blame Leah for falling for Carter, who does and says all the right things. Herein lies the appeal of the story. We ve all been in Leah s shoes. We know what a risk it is to meet complete strangers and begin dating them. We ve all seen Fatal Attraction and in the back of our minds lurks the fearful possibility that we re falling for a Glenn Close-like character.

GREG: The Perfect Guy reminds me of last year s No Good Deed. In it, a woman helps a man who is on the run. He seems nice enough at first, but ultimately the movie turns into a long chase scene with the plucky damsel in distress ultimately doing in the bad guy. Here, Leah does everything she should do (including calling the police) but Carter keeps coming back. The movie ends with Leah killing Carter with a shotgun. Leah is a pretty good hero. She s smart and resourceful. She doesn t fall into a lump and cry because she doesn t like her situation. She changes her phone number. She calls the police. She asserts herself and gets a restraining order. She learns to shoot a gun. This is a take-charge woman who knows what she wants.

SCOTT: I agree, Greg, that Leah s hero s journey is fairly solid. At first she lacks the ability to take control of her life and survive the threat that Carter represents. With the help of her police mentor, Detective Hansen (Holt McCallany), she learns to become self-sufficient and gains self-confidence in the process. At the beginning of the movie, this is a woman who is vulnerable; by the movie s end, this is a woman you don t want to mess with. She also discovers an important truth: It isn t easy to find and fall in love with the right person, and so when you do, it s best not to let anything come between you and the well-being of that relationship. The supporting characters are limited in size but quite strong. Carter was indeed a wonderful guy on the surface and would have fooled me, too. He s an effective deceptive villain. Dave is a sweet friend and lover to Leah, a strong, silent type. Detective Hansen is a bit stereotypical as the police sergeant who is limited in what he can do to help Leah, but he emerges as an indispensable help to her. Leah s two girlfriends are rather forgettable. But overall, as with the hero s story, we have a solid herd of supporting characters.

GREG: I liked that they gave Carter a bit of backstory to explain his evil ways. You see, Carter was adopted. And he felt abandoned by the fact that his birth parents didn t want him. This avoids the  pure evil  character that we warn about in our book  Reel Heroes & Villains.  You want your villain to have a pain that he succumbs to - as a way of explaining why the villain turned to evil. The Perfect Guy isn t the perfect movie. It isn t the perfect horror. Nor is it the perfect thriller. But it is a good way to pass a couple hours in the dark. The one thing that left me wondering is a scene Leah has with her mother. She asks Mom how she knew Dad was the one. Mom replies that he was persistent - no matter how many times she said no, he still kept on trying. It s a nice little story. But it, too, smacks of stalking. What s the lesson then? I don t think anyone can parse a lesson out of this film which is why I give it a middling score of 3 out of 5 Reels. Leah is a decent hero. As you point out, Scott, she travels a nice arc from being vulnerable to being able to fend for herself. We don t get much backstory for her, though. It is apparently enough that she is a mature woman of thirty-something and naturally wants children. We don t see any negative traits to her, aside from throwing out a perfectly good man just because he isn t ready to procreate. I give Leah just 3 out of 5 Heroes. And our secondary characters are pretty much par for the course. I enjoyed Michael Ealy s Carter character. He was likable and sinister at the same time. The other characters (Detective Hanson, Mom and Dad, the dueling BFFs) were hardly worth writing home about. Not to mention (we almost didn t) the bland next door neighbor who you knew was going to die from the moment you see her on the screen. I was going to give them all just two cast points, but Ealy was great in this film. So I ve incremented their score to 3 out of 5 Cast points.  Movie: Cast: Heroes:

SCOTT: I wouldn t recommend The Perfect Guy to couples who are on their first date or two, or to people who love being surprised by a movie s twists and turns. There are no twists and turns in The Perfect Guy. It s perfectly predictable, but also perfectly innocuous and semi-appealing if you don t mind turning your brain off and basking in seeing someone else have a worse love life than yours. I give this movie 2 Reels out of 5. The hero s journey is quite respectable in showing how Leah transforms from a na ve, dependent woman into a strong, independent force to be reckoned with. There is excellent mentoring from the police detective and friends and allies who assist Leah on her journey. None of this is academy award material, but it s still a decent hero s story. I give Leah 3 Heroes out of 5. The three main supporting characters -- Dave, Carter, and Hansen   do a fine job of helping or opposing Leah. I was shocked that the cat survived this movie, as I was 100% convinced that it would be boiled to death like the bunny in Fatal Attraction. For some reason, Leah never even connected the bland neighbor s death to Carter, which I found to be an odd omission in the film. Overall, these characters earn 3 out of 5 cast points.

"3464",1013,"Not the worst WWII movie I've seen. They did a good job with authentic uniforms and weapons for the most part. 

Rourke's part in the film was completely ridiculous. It almost seemed like he showed up on set, wore what he wanted and shot his part. He probably said, ""you want me in your move I'm going to do what I want whether you like it or not"" only explanation I can come up with for him wearing a flippin cowboy hat, and long hair in an otherwise well costumed movie. I'm guessing maybe he and Dolph came as a package deal? He's by far the worst part of the movie...eliminate him and I might have given it 3 stars.

Other than his horrible French accent, Dolph wasnt nearly as bad as some of the roles I've seen him in. Not quite sure why they made him into a legionnaire though. Better option would have been to let him act in his natural voice and just have him be a special forces instructor instead of trying to force him into a French role.

The German officer was a bit over the top as well...GI dog tags, unit patches...I'm just not sure why in a movie looking pretty authentic that they would stray from that with Rourke and the German officer....

Overall, its not a horrible film, but I wouldnt go out of my way to watch it. Make a few changes and it could have been much better.",2

Just when you thought Drac's predictable character development has finally passed by and you can stop disliking him for his selfish needs, this out of nowhere villain appears to give the movie a climax, and it all ends with a lame-ass fight scene with overexaggerated animation that makes the action more stilted than engaging.",2

The movie definitely knows how to pull at your heartstrings, though Michael Shannon's character, ostensibly the bad guy of the film (and he does do some illegal and unethical things) is right about a lot more than he is wrong about; a fact likely overlooked by most audiences.

"3485",1034,"99 Homes tackles increasingly relevant yet to some degree historic themes in a splendid, mostly realistic examination of the seedy side of capitalism and the trials of those consigned to roles at the bottom of the United States society. Some of the drama appears overwrought and the character arc of Garfield's protagonist quite predictable, but his work along with fellow headliners Dern and Shannon do the business. I also want to mention the minor actors in the film, as every line seemed weighted and directed to perfection despite the film's small scale and the actors' small parts. Moral decay and critiques of the government and society are all too common in Hollywood, ironically from those feeding from the top, but 99 Homes never loses its genuine tone of fury mixed with a surprising understanding and sympathy for those acting as cogs in the brutal business machine throughout a screenplay that combines a thoughtfulness with the necessary brashness and ignorance of the culture.",4

Until we are the ones that are evicted on a conclusive ending. As fast as the movie started, it stopped. There was much more that could have been portrayed and resolved from the character of Dennis Nash and the outcome of his business with Rick Carver.

Really great film with phenomenal performances from the three main stars.",4

"3490",1039,"99 Homes is a solid drama with a base plot about the after effects of the housing boon ending abruptly and the recent economic recession costing thousands of people their family homes. The banking system and real estate brokers act together to foreclose on homes when mortgage payments get too far behind, loans are defaulted on. But the film is actually the people who are affected most by these actions and how drastically it can change them.
Michael Shannon gives his usual brilliant performance, here as a real estate broker who sees all those who he takes advantage of or work for him as beneath him; something to be used for his great financial and egotistical gains. Andrew Garfield is his equal here as Dennis Nash, one of those thousands who lost their source of income when the housing market crashed, and so he lost his family home as well. He then gets a chance to get it back, but it means subjugating, debasing himself and his moral compass (also very much a class-based sense of self) by working for broker Carver. Now he is the one giving the tragic news to now former home owners. Just how far can he submerge his true self in this for that home and tremendous monetary gain in the face of the outright suffering it brings all these people who are very much just like him? We see him later at Carver's party at this swank house with beautiful people, including one on his arm to go with Carver's giggly 'sweetheart' he cheats on his own wife with.
Great work from director Ramin Bahrani and co-writer Naderi on a lean, focused movie with consistent strong tone that keeps you locked  into the moral struggle at work here. We see decent hardworking people turned into shells of their formers selves; from withering figures to violent, raving hostiles. There's a final act that works so well and is essential to Nash's ultimate decision on which path to take which in less skilled, confident hands could well have been one of porous melodrama. 3.7 stars",4

At the same time it was the only gay bar in New York where dancing was allowed.

In this period, little was allowed to gays in USA: in the years immediately after the Second World War, thousands of people lost their jobs in the military and government for suspicion of being gay.

Police made constant raids on gay bars, the customers were arrested, their pictures published in the newspapers.

This period also witnessed a rise of progressive and liberation movements which marked the 1960s, and it was only a question of when this enormous suffering, discontent and discrimination of the gay community will spill over into the fight for equal rights.

"3508",1057,"(from The Watermark 11/23/96)
A semi-fictional story about the famous 1969 riots which helped begin the modern gay movement,  is both thought-provoking and entertaining. A young gay midwesterner moves to Greenwich Village to be free to express his sexuality. But all he finds is a plethora of gay clubs that are constantly terrorized and raided by the police. He becomes romantically involved with a drag queen, and joins a political committee which is forming to promote equal rights for homosexuals. The organization has strict rules about conservative appearance and visibility which make him feel he must turn away from his bangled boyfriend if he wants to pursue The Cause. It is a familiar love story that puts a nice personal spin on an important piece of our history. It then adds a cute dimension of fun by punctuating the plot points with drag queens lip-synching obscure 1960's girl tunes. Not only does it stand as dramatic documentation of how far our movement has come,  is also an eye-opening reminder of how much farther we need to go, and how we will never achieve our goals without unifying our own community.",5

Gerry (Ben Mendelsohn) is a man who seems to have lost everything except the debts he owes to others.  Together, they travel from Iowa to New Orleans to partake in a high-stakes poker game.  This is a film about the ugly side of addiction, in this case gambling.  The film succeeds thanks to strong performances from the leads and some clever dialogue by writers and directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.

It seems a lot of the negative reviewers have a lack of appreciation for cinema and ventured out of their normal genre. This is a slow burn drama with multiple, very large kicks throughout.

The A-list cast does very well too, with familiar faces constantly appearing even after you thought that they'd included enough. The ending is a bit predictable, however, and the story at the end is pretty generic. However, this is quickly overshadowed by all the great things about this film.

The film at times may be light on content, but it does paint a vague portrait of Steve Jobs and gives you enough insight into the man and his legacy. For its short run time of 60 minutes, One Last Thing is a pretty good effort and manages to be entertaining, but at times it could have been better as well. However, the film is well worth seeing if you're interested in the subject and it works quite well for what it tries to accomplish. Apple computers are one of the most financially successful companies and Steve Jobs created something unique and this short gives an insight into his story. Although not truly in depth, the documentary manages to give you enough facts to know more about jobs and his contribution to the tech industry. For what it is, it manages to tell an impressive and interesting story about the man who changed the way we do things, and if you're looking to know about Steve Jobs, this is quite entertaining for what it is, but at the same time a more thorough documentary about Steve Jobs would be great.

I think it is weird to make documentary films out of interviews unless that movie talks about that certain thing, but if it's just a regular interview with the interviewer asking questions to Steve Jobs and he answered, it doesn't really work and felt like it should've been free. But with that said, it is a great interview movie. The ways in detail that Steve Jobs say, makes you interested in this guy. There might be some parts where I wasn't that interested, but Steve Jobs still does kept me interested in what he say till the end.

The performances are good, but not perfect. Guillermo Del Toro made his seal in a classic mystery movie adapting it for a new generation, but I think that it wasn't the better way to do it.

It has a bit of an identity crisis but comes together in the end due to a coherent aesthetic and consistent tone. Recommended for a rainy day movie.",3
"3576",1125,"Lots of hype and some great actors but not much of a pay off",3
"3577",1126,"An intriguing tale of Gothic romance and mystery.

Director Guillermo Del Toro's Gothic romance horror mystery Crimson Peak (2015) is always rewarding to revisit with Del Toro's haunting atmosphere and gorgeous visuals. I was enthralled by his dark sensibilities for his enigmatic mystery. Crimson Peak is stylishly directed by Guillermo, but not his best work as it could be less predictable and more chilling. It isolates and astonishes me all the same. It's quite the horrific tale of betrayal and manipulation with a toxic romance.

I do think Guillermo Del Toro's writing has some flaws like the balcony fall not killing the victim or numerous stab wounds seeming paltry in wounding effect. I like how Matthew Robbins and Guillermo Del Toro's ghost story combines several Gothic tales into one fearsome film. Del Toro takes the incest plotline from Cruel Intentions, the bleak Gothic wilderness of Wuthering Heights, the unending lies of Gaslight, the controlling relationship of Rebecca, and the sincere tragic romance of Jane Eyre for his version of a Gothic period drama. 

I wish much of the impressive CGI were practical effects like Guillermo's classic pictures. But, Guillermo's Gothic direction is so engaging and his slow burn pacing affects your senses, that Crimson Peak keeps you interested for 119 minutes. Editor Bernat Vilaplana's quick horror cuts are startling, while his moodier editing pace keeps Crimson Peak crawling towards its bloody conclusion. Crimson Peak is underrated and underappreciated for its compelling visual flair.

Mia Wasikowska is heartfelt and gentle as the curious heroine. Jessica Chastain is frightening as the clearly deranged and ulterior motivated sister and lady of the house. Her fearsome supporting performance is commanding and chilling to witness. Tom Hiddleston is both charming and creepy as a suave gentleman with money on his mind. Charlie Hunnam gets back into his Nicolas Nickleby mode as the handsome doctor and friend to Mia Wasikowska. Jim Beaver has gravitas as a controlling and concerned father. Burn Gorman's shifty private detective seems as sinister as Jessica Chastain. Leslie Hope is so snide and cruel with her every word. Jonathan Hyde was nice to see again with his quaint character. Doug Jones is freaky as the shocking ghosts.

Dan Laustsen's cinematography looks amazing with these eerie wide shots of the red clay that looks like blood red guts. Laustsen's close-ups are peerless and classic cinema in appearance. Thomas E. Sanders' production design builds a decrepit manor that is run down to holes in the ceiling and crimson clay leaking in from the floorboards. Brandt Gordon's art direction creates scary ghost designs and beautiful Gothic aesthetics for Crimson Peak. All the set decorators create a realistic and heightened Gothic world like the visual effects artists with their realistically gory CGI.

Composer Fernando Velázquez writes a beautiful symphony that fits Crimson Peak's ravishing music. His score wraps Crimson Peak in wondrous romance and Gothic tragedy. Costume designers Kate Hawley, Cori Burchell, and Erin Daprato weave all of Gothic history with love into these splendid dresses. I loved the vivid colors and haunting designs choices. Make-up artists Jordan Samuel, Linda Dowds, Mario Cacioppo, Montse Ribé, and Krista Burbidge did phenomenal work with the visual aesthetics of each character's pale look.

In all, Crimson Peak is better than I remembered, but not without its unfortunate flaws. Mia Wasikowska and Jessica Chastain's performances as actresses are magnificently captivating.",4

"3590",1139,""""" is the true story of one of the first high schools in Alabama to become integrated.  This initially caused a lot of friction, especially among the football players who did not want black players on their team.  In an effort to stop the fighting, a local evangelist makes a request to speak to the  football team and the coach reluctantly agrees.  After an hour long talk the evangelist, Hank, is able to convert the entire team into followers of Jesus.  At this time in the early seventies, what was known as the Jesus Movement was in full swing and this is a grand example of that movement's power.  The evangelist, Hank, continues to mentor the team with Bible studies after practice and the black and white players work together to turn in an unexpected winning season.  One black player, Tony Nathan, who is an amazing talent, turns out to be the star and is courted by legendary university of Alabama coach Bear Bryant.  The following season starts with a summer practice that includes the cross-town rival team and all the members of that team end up being converted to followers of Jesus as well.  In the end, the  coach is threatened with termination if he continues to pray with his team before games but in the play-off game with the cross-town rivals who are also believers, they recite the Lord's Prayer with the entire stadium in defiance of the school board.  Tony Nathan goes on to play for the University of Alabama and the  High School coach ends up selling insurance; however, before the credits roll it is revealed he later returns to coaching.

This is a story well told.  For believers, this is a joyous celebration of what God can do: The whole team is converted, they then have a winning season, a star player is born, the bitter cross town rivalry is dissolved into respectful sportsman-like play - all because of Jesus. If I didn't know it to be a true story I would say it's too contrived - but it's apparently all true. Keep in mind this is a story about football; so if you're not a football fan it might not be for you.  Ultimately, this is a story about God working in the lives of a group of young people and how that empowerment changes a community.  Overall, I think most followers of Jesus Christ will find this story inspiring.",4

"3592",1141,"Pretty good stuff here. I love Sarsgaard anyway, and he fits this role really well. I'm not at all surprised with the reactions Milgram's work got. People really like to think the best of themselves and others, except, of course, for those they want to think little of, or even the worst of. Oh, but not themselves (though I'm clearly leaving out those with abysmal self-image). 
Gaffigan was fairly Gaffigan, but he got the job done. Leguizamo has a nice cameo as one of the study subjects. Edwards and Yelchin are fine in the same position. Dennis Haysbert makes a good Ossie Davis, though it is kinda funny. But Lutz is a lousy Shatner. Speaking of Shatner, Betty White just.....And no, that's not Daryl Hannah but the long lost Lori Singer. Ryder was disappointing for me. Seemed to phone this one in. 
I generally dislike the whole obvious breaking the fourth wall, talking straight to the audience thing. Seems contrived, cheesy, hammy often. But I can see how it can be used for exposition, and can be a way of bringing in comedy, too. But I think here director Almereyda was going for a theater stage context, which works with the hand-drawn type backdrops that are used at times.
I wonder if the 'playfulness', as some reviewers call it, is there to offset the disturbing experiment results, the Eichmann/Nazi/Pogrom material. It does detract from the film, imo. Let it be what it is.
Very heavy, heady subject matter here, and it was handled well in a film context. And yes, I got the elephant in the room. 3 stars",3
"3593",1142,"I was highly disappointed with this movie. I thought this would be more about Milgram's experiments than his personal life, but I was unfortunately wrong. The parts that did recount the experiments were interesting, but I don't feel it got the attention it deserved. The film tried to be too ""artsy"" and cool, and was just weird in parts. I found it very boring. I seriously considered turning it off. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time with this film.",2
"3594",1143,"The first 30 minutes of the film is about all you need. After that, it gets real old, real fast. The experiment is not that hard to understand. After that the film becomes more about Milgram who isn't that interesting. Often encounters are patched into the film that simply add running time but add nothing to the film. And the documentary approach becomes quite boring after awhile. I barely paid attention over the last 45 minutes. Neither the film or Milgrahm's experiment add much to human understanding and insight. Why so many praise the film is beyond me.",3

A character study on Milgram isn't the case nor does it explore anything more intricate about how the experiments affect our understanding of the world. Also, the marriage between him and his wife lacks any sort of turmoil that I think it was trying to build, which makes the final 5 minutes completely unearned.",2

An interesting premise in an unusual setting - and more based in reality than I had assumed.  There was a female Pashtun contestant in the finale of the third season of Afghan Star, and Setara Hussainzeda, to whom the movie was dedicated,  was a female performer eliminated in an earlier round who received death threats for dancing.  The mixture of goofy and deadly was somewhat odd, but it didn't ruin the movie for me. In addition to the characters and acting I also enjoyed the music.  The movie was something different, in a good way.",4

It does a fantastic job of making the memory flashes throughout the movie a way to keep the plot moving at a fast pace, instead of being either useless or an irritating interruption of the plot. It stayed on track, was easy to follow, and gives the viewers both: a guess of what the characters consider a happy ending, and enough questions and dangers to hope for a sequel. I loved every minute of the movie, it held my attention from start to finish.",5

"3650",29,"As a technical experiment, this movie is absolutely amazing considering the low-budget, for despite the fact that you can tell what is real and unreal (in terms of CGI and edits) clearly from time to time, the fact that it works as well as it does is nothing short of miraculous.  Along with that, however, it tells a surprisingly creative and nuanced story for what it is, with a twist at the end that was quite the shocker, but fortunately, this twist didn't undermine ANY of the movie that came before it, and in fact, I think it made the payoff of the film's conclusion all the more satisfying.  Better yet, you don't understand the story as it plays out, but neither does Henry, so as a result, you learn everything as he does, and from his direct perspective, and how this big twist is revealed, and how it immediately leads into the final action sequence, is inventive in itself.  The action is very creative, and the way how the next scene will play out is almost entirely unpredictable, and the finale is absolutely insane, with a showdown with the film's intriguing main villain that is both inventive and ultra-cathartic.  It's not perfect, as there are a few chunks in the beginning where you take the perspective of someone trying (unsuccessfully) to run away from the enemy, and then it turns into a series of chases rather than an outright action movie, but when the action itself fully kicks in, it's absolutely stellar.  If you are an action buff and have a high-tolerance for camera-driven motion sickness, then I cannot recommend this enough.",4

The whole time you are seeing this from Will's perspective and wondering what is real and what isn't.  Is Will just being paranoid or does he have real reason to be afraid?  If you have not yet seen The Invitation, I strongly suggest you take a moment to watch it, you will not be disappointed.",5

"3669",48,"L'azione si svolge dieci anni dopo la fine della prima guerra mondiale, in una cittadina della Francia. Il protagonista, Julien Davenne, è un reduce di guerra che lavora come redattore al giornale «Le Globe». È specializzato in annunci funebri («un virtuoso della necrologia», come lo definisce il suo capo redattore) e il pensiero della morte, osservata da vicino durante la guerra, lo accompagna in ogni momento. Al piano superiore della sua casa - dove vive con l'anziana governante, signora Rambaud, e Georges, un ragazzo sordomuto - Davenne ha riservato una camera al culto della moglie Julie, morta undici anni prima nel pieno della sua bellezza. Durante un temporale, nella camera verde si sviluppa un incendio. Davenne riesce a salvare le foto e i ritratti della moglie ma capisce che ciò che ha fatto non basta più. Quando scopre una cappella abbandonata e in rovina, nello stesso cimitero in cui Julie è sepolta, Julien decide di restaurarla per consacrarla non solo alla moglie ma a tutti i suoi morti, essendo giunto «a quel punto della vita in cui si conoscono più morti che vivi». Quel luogo sacro si trasformerà in una selva di candele accese, una foresta di fiamme che illuminerà le foto appese alle pareti di tutte le persone che hanno contato nella sua vita.

A custodire la cappella insieme a lui, Davenne chiama una giovane donna, Cécilia, segretaria della casa d'aste da cui ha riacquistato un anello già appartenuto a Julie. L'amicizia tra i due, forte di questa complicità, sembra potersi evolvere in un sentimento diverso, quando accade l'imprevisto: muore Paul Massigny, l'uomo politico francese che tempo prima aveva tradito Davenne (nel film non si dice in cosa consistesse il tradimento), dopo essere stato il suo miglior amico. Quando si reca per la prima volta a casa di Cécilia, che sta dando lezione di pianoforte, Davenne scopre che il salotto è pieno di foto di Massigny e, senza chiedere spiegazioni, se ne va. Alla cappella, Cécilia gli rivela di essere stata una delle tante donne di Massigny e, nonostante il male che le ha fatto, di amarlo ancora. Perciò chiede che anche Massigny possa essere rappresentato da una delle candele sull'altare dei morti. Al secco rifiuto di Davenne, Cécilia rompe i rapporti e l'uomo crolla: chiuso in casa, rifiuta di mangiare, di vedere il medico, di parlare. Consigliata dal caporedattore de «Le Globe», Cécilia allora gli scrive una lettera e, finalmente, gli dichiara il suo amore, pur sapendo che lui non potrà mai ricambiarlo: «perché per essere amata da Lei, dovrei essere morta». Julien la raggiunge nella cappella: ha perdonato Massigny, ma privo di forze cade per terra e muore. Cécilia completa l'opera, come lui tempo prima le aveva chiesto, accendendo un'ultima candela per Julien Davenne.

"3674",53,"Garbage film-making.  I've been to Saudi a number of times.  15 minutes into this movie, I'm really struggling to reconcile the real Saudi Arabia with what is being shown here.  

The first thing that got on my nerves is a small thing, but for me it stood out like a sore thumb: I highly doubt that any hotel, let alone the Hyatt Jeddah, would ever book an unshaven, ungroomed driver with a 30-year-old car for any visiting US executive - ever.  

And even if they did, any driver would know not to enter the destination building with the US executive.  As for the portrayal of the greeting from the Saudi representative, the idea that the first meeting would be so extremely discourteous is just wrong.  

There is just no way the Saudi rep would be that rude, and equally, no way that he would drop the US exec off two hundred meters from the entrance of the destination building and make him walk the balance of the distance in the hot sun - that just isn't going to happen, not even to that guy's worst enemy.    

As for the assumption that dozens of hectares of sand cannot be turned into cities... maybe take a peek at the timelapse of the Dubai Expo from its first groundbreaking to where it is today, just four years later.  

It gets worse.  The scene where Hanks and the female Saudi doctor are along in the room during an examination for a minor medical issue...  I found that pretty hard to believe - but 20 minutes later they are alone in a hotel room... and get 'busted' by his driver, who presumably has the run of the hotel...  

And then ten minutes later Hanks - a Westerner and presumably a non-Muslim - is driving through Mecca looking every bit the Westerner that he is.  Then five minutes later, he is taking pictures and joking sarcastically that he is a part-time CIA spy to a bunch of people that barely speak English.  And five minutes after that they are shooting guns in the desert... 

Then 20 mins later, the female doctor relives the male surgeon, Hanks and her reprise sleepless in Seattle over email, and head off on a date together.  Where they discuss each other's divorces.  And she gets topless underwater.  And they sleep together, unnoticed, at her house.  And fall in love.  And then he emails his kids and says I'm not coming back to the US for a while.

And that's pretty much the end.  Sorry if I spoiled the ending for you - but on the bright side, I saved you an hour of bad movie-making.

The only things they got right in this movie are: the hotels can be indeed luxurious, there are indeed highly educated women working in Saudi, the Red Sea is spectacular, and a lot of Saudis have attended college in the US.  

The fact that Tom Hanks is in this hot mess of a picture is the only reason I managed to keep watching this for as long as I did.",1

"3692",71,"I expected a bit more from Money Monster. On paper, it seemed like a sure thing for me, a ninety minute thriller more or less taking place in the same place for the duration (think Phone Booth [2002]). Ever reliable George Clooney is Lee Gates, who hosts his own show giving advice on investments. However, the film kicks off with the opening of a live show which is hijacked by Jack O'Connell, who walks into the studio with a gun, determined to give Gates his comeuppance after he recently lost money after advice from Gates. The set up is solid, the performances are all good, but Money Monster runs out of steam in the final third. It's also hugely irritating to see the hysteria of bystanders all over the city with hands clasped over their mouths watching the drama unfold on their phones, as the whole events play out live on television. Even more annoying is the final stretch as the action moves onto the street, with people all over the sidewalks horrified and shocked......but not horrified or shocked enough to be unable to take out their phones and film it all for personal benefit. This is of course at the very least realistic, and I can't blame the film for accurately depicting society in this fashion, but as soon as the action moves outside my waning interest was lost. It's great to see George Clooney and Julia Roberts back sharing a screen together, and Jack O'Connell remains one of the best talents on screen in this day and age. Money Monster is far from terrible, there is some well built tension early on, but if you want a short financial thriller that plays out just as well with racketing tension from start to finish you would do well to search out Margin Call (2011).",3
"3693",72,"Really good movie with an interesting plot. Perhaps a bit of a deeper look into the antagonist and a better and clearer lead up to the unravelling of the mystery of where the $800M went exactly was needed though. Discovering what actually happened and the truth about the losses happened very fast and without us as viewers really investing in finding out and understanding how the show found out exactly. Not enough foreshadowing to give the big reveal a strong enough impact.

The beats and script is literally like a hard hard perfect ""Hollywood Action"" template, I mean it ticks all the checklist: Start off nice, unexpected hostage and air it on live TV - a bomb and negotiation phases.

There are some marvelous character actors running around who make the film bearable.  Poor George Sanders looks rather lost and bored as the requisite silly, by-the-book British officer who finally gets wise when the American (sorry, Canadian!!!) goes rogue.

[i]The beautiful Gene Tierny stars as a mysterious merchant princess in """"[/i][/center]


"""" is a fairly run-of-the-mill colonial drama, with the steadfast British troops and their valiant native allies standing fast against those who would bring low Britain. It's got a more interesting cast of characters than many of these films--with the liberal minded Crawford truly standing out--and the cast is mostly excellent. The film also benefits from a more exotic locale than many of these films, and the gorgeous photography takes full advantage of this, as does the script. (One bit of repetition that made me scratch my head: why did the bad guys always get gunned down in pools of water?)

Aside from the great camera work, another reason to see """" is the presence of the absolutely gorgeous Gene Tierney. She truly is one of the most beautiful actresses to ever appear on film, and she doesn't do a whole lot more than walk around looking exotic and gorgeous here. If you haven't seen Tierney do majestically beautiful, you need to see this movie.

"3756",135,"The famous book titled ""Me before You"" written by Jojo Moyes was a very nice story and an endless reading of this kind of book. This book or novel from way back 2012 was also adopted in a film making and released on June 03, 2016 and the characters on the film were so realistic and making it all easier to the audience to understand what was trying to interpret from the author named Jojo Moyes. I haven't read the novel but the first time I've watched the movie in the theatres I have just realized that the moment I was done finishing the movie, it was just so memorable for me because it makes me motivated about my life. People nowadays just make their lives dangerous and end their life as simple as they thought but they don't notice that there are also some people who dreams and trying to reach for their goals and never giving on their fight on being a successful one, we should be thankful that were given a life to create dreams come true because for me dreams come true and it's real if you strive on your own and make things realistic and that's when the time you'll know that your dreams come true.

This novel is written by Jojo Moyes and the characters on the novel are William Traynor is a successful banker who is in a relationship with her girlfriend named Alicia and Louisa Clark is a cheerful and an outgoing lady who just suddenly lost her job at a local café and now she is seeking for a job. But in the of misfortune of William Traynor he was injured on a motorcycle accident and he is paralyzed and also taking some medications and two years passed, Lou or Louisa was hired as an companion of William Traynor because William's mother believed that Lou's personality can change the attitude and will lift up all the motivations of her son. After a several weeks Will Traynor has a visit from his best friend and also now his ex- girlfriend Alicia telling him that they're now engaged and he is invited to their wedding but Will suddenly become violent and angry, which Lou is trying to help him. The days has come Will and Lou become best friends and also has develop some strong feelings between their bond together but Lou's long time boyfriend named Patrick has noticed their strange feelings and header to their break up. When they were on a vacation in the place of Switzerland having some happy and cheerful moments little did not know Lou that Will is now suffering and dying and it becomes that Will's parents noticed that and they don't want their son to suffer from dying and now Lou  already knows about this when she hear the topic of Will's parents but it was now too late that his man is dead. A few weeks after the death of Will, Lou received a letter while she is on her favourite café shop in the place of Paris and it is written on the letter and left an enough amount of money to continue to strive on her dreams and goals.

I recommend this novel to every people who loses hope on their life and just wants to end their life because being alive is a blessing on Earth and we should be thankful that we have the opportunity to make our dreams come true and to be a successful one. Never give up on your battle just keep on striving until you've reached your goals. This full of realistic romance and also full of challenges in life is a must read for everyone.",4

"3758",137,"This movie has some truly scary moments. Similar to the first Conjuring, it has a good family story.",4
"3759",138,"The Conjuring 2 doesn't waste time in bringing the scares in. By that, I mean you're pretty much in the thick of it from the get-go, being given some background (via another very notorious haunting incident) for what is to follow.

The Warrens are sent on behalf of the church to investigate some paranormal activity which is whipping up a media storm in Enfield, England and, as per the first movie, they go and attempt to work their magic on the situation. Once again, a family is being haunted and they fear for their sanity and lives. There are a few new twists this time round, so all does not play out as before - but it's not a complete departure from the format, which might have made it a bit more gripping in places.

James Wan's trademark visual style is repeated in this movie - his bag of tricks sometimes yielding a sense of deja vu but generally working like a charm. When it's intended to scare, it really does. The scares come a bit more frequently than in the first movie and do manage to build a lot of tension, even if you've seen the original, so well done to Wan for that.

What's really enjoyable about this movie, is its nostalgic recreation of 70s England. Wan has really done a great job of this, which is surprising given that he's not from there. Also, the central support role of Janet Hodgson is pretty crucial to empathising with the Enfield family and Madison Wolfe gives a solid performance.

It's arguable this one is as strong as the first. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed part one, or indeed likes movies of a haunting or possession theme.

The most memorable and entertaining trick was the hidden card, which after getting over the well performed trick and throws and passes, you realize it could have been way simpler if one person just kept the card hidden, for example Atlas when he had it hidden in his jacket lining, and just kept it there instead of throwing it around the room a thousand times and almost getting caught a thousand times.

Harrelson portrays twin brothers, which dazzles and shines, he's acting with himself and it is funny, yet forced once or twice.

Franco lives up to his brothers name, and does his part, and the rest just do very well all mixed together. Seeing Daniel Radcliffe was a surprise, even Michael Caine returning wasn't too obvious but thought they moved on without his character.

Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson are great in this movie. At it's core it's another wacky buddy flick not unlike Hart's other comedy Ride Along or Johnson's The Other Guys. The difference here is that Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson have a chemistry together that rivals the greats. Not only were the two funny together, but they played off of each other so well that the other problems this movie had, namely it's anemic third act and disjointed resolution, didn't ruin my experience.

All in all, it's not the best buddy comedy in the world, but it's by no means the worst. I enjoyed watching it for the most part and Johnson and Hart have great onscreen chemistry that is worth the price of admission.

The comedy, as well as most of the action was great. However, the plot gets murky and the close-up combat scenes look awful which unfortunately, bring down the movie a little bit.

"3808",187,"A ridiculously good looking chick (Blake Lively) goes surfing alone on a totally secluded beach in Mexico and gets attacked by a shark. The kindly Mexican guy who gives her a ride to the beach asks her how she expcects to get a ride back to her hotel, and she says, ""Uber."" No Uber driver on earth could find this place. 
There is no explanation why she would do something so senseless (other than the fact that her dead mother took her there when she was a kid). 
Stranded on a rock, and later a signal buoy, Lively fights off the shark (which is fake and computer-generated, but apparently quite hungry) for an interminable period of time. A helpful seagull decides to sit on the rock with her. 
Then, Lively collects her milion dollar paycheck and goes back to her opulent Hollywood home. I don't think the seagull got paid, though.

"3819",198,"Most Americans know at least a little about John's Brown's slave revolt at Harper's Ferry. Brown was a white northern abolitionist. Far fewer  Americans know about Nat Turner's slave insurrection in Virginia. Turner was a black preacher. There is no doubt that history has been ""whitened,"" as Malcolm X proclaimed
Therefore, I'm happy to see this film, the true story of Newton Knight, a white, anti-slavery Mississippi farmer who deserted the Confederate army and joined a group of runaway slaves. Together, they form the ""Free State of Jones County,"" a band of vigilantes who avenge the poor southern families whose food and belongings have been confiscated by the southern ""tax collectors."" The group expands as some Confederate soldiers and local farmers join up. They go to rich plantations and raid them. They stop the tax collectors at gunpoint and reclaim the corn they have stolen. Then they retreat back to their hideout in the swamp ---where the calvary can't go. Needless to say, the Confederate army is not happy. Knight's face is on wanted posters all over the state as a deserter and a traitor.
I'm sure there is plenty of Hollywood embellishment to the story, but nevertheless, it's just so damned great to see whites and blacks working together and looking out for each other. Of course, all is not perfect. There is internal dissention. And yes, there is violence. What mass human rights violation has been stopped without violence? I can't think of one.
Matthew McConaughey is the right lead actor for this story. He's gruff but righteous. We root for him.

"3845",224,"Don't listen to the bad reviews, this is a very good movie, I enjoyed it so much and it respects a lot the stories of Tarzan of the apes. Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgård were perfect for the roles, one of my favorite films, I'm not exaggerating.",5
"3846",225,"Extremely underrated film! Alexander Skarsgard did a magnificent job with the great iconic character of Tarzan. It seems a lot of people don't understand that this film is following the book of origin for the story about ""The Ape Man"". Because of how different this story is from the other past movie adaptations of this storie origin, it seems most were looking forward to seeing the normal story but were taken aback by this films different story.

The acting is very well done! Every actor did a great job with the characters they were given! However... the actual characters themselves are a different thing. Leon Rom is the main protagonist, whose personality seems a bit bland and very strange type of villain to put up against anyone is this film, for his only strengths are that he is cunning, can squirm out of situations, and can wrap a necklace around other people's necks to choke them to death... Not quite a strong villain to bring a good ending battle against a character fabled to be ""The Ape Man"". 
Now with another character I had a very hard time with... George Washington (played by Samuel Jackson). The dialog and personality that they made for this character is very strange and odd, where it could have been done a lot better. Though, of course, Samuel Jackson did the very best he could at acting out this character. 
These two characters are the reason I cannot give this film more than 4 stars.

The story, very close to its book origin, is quite a different tale than most are used to for when watching a film about ""Tarzan"". This starts out after he is married to Jane and lives in London, but then goes back to Africa and finds that it is in serious need of his help.

This is one problem many viewers have with this film, which is that the gorilla species in this film are very different than how real apes are. This is strange to me, because in the book the gorillas are a type of species the writer made up. So, they are not supposed to be just like real apes. I loved the way the story explains the gorillas from the book, and how Tarzan must deal with them in order to gain their trust. 

Overall, a very well done film that I like to watch many times! Other than those two characters in this film, this movie is a masterpiece production that tires to follow the origin story as best as it could!",4

"3872",251,"""Captain Fantastic"" is audacious and seems to revel in its own contradictions. Some have criticized it for being heavy on didacticism. Perhaps.

Is Mortenson's Ben a dictator? Yes. His kids are victims. But as he softens up in the final acts, we realize that what we think is best for our kids is often misguided. 
Actually, were it not for the language and nudity, this could have been marketed as a family film. It's too bad, because I think it would stimulate some meaningful discussions between parents and kids.",4

I emotionally understood the central conflict i.e. how to balance giving your children the best start without ostracizing them to the point they struggle to participate in normal society. It did paint an idealized view of living off the grid rather than include some of the more mundane issues that would surely arise in daily life, but I felt this was forgivable. The only part I truly take issue with is the decision by Bo at the end to travel to Namibia after he [put (his) finger on a map]. Whilst Namibia is actually a really good fit for him to develop as a young man given his current skill set, I felt this decision should have been the result of careful research by him and his father rather than just made on a whim.

"3889",268,"Well made for the most part but not without its flaws. The plot was engaging enough throughout, but it's not very distinguished from other films in the genre, the main character would have been discovered due to that tape machine, the guy in the yellow car would have been caught after his informant pal ratted on him, the whole police ordeal at the port probably would have got them caught, some of the things they were saying were ridiculous, real undercover agents likely don't talk about the mission so close to the people they're trying to fool or in public, the main characters should have been arrested at the wedding too for their own safety to act it off, the person driving the car around was poorly explained and insignificant, some cuts could have been better, the runtime was a tad too long, several actors didn't quite match the original people (e.g. the obvious age difference of the main character, blonde hair for his fake fiancé), the ending felt rushed, classy drug dealers and money launderers shouldn't necessarily be presented as decent people, further character development wouldn't have been a bad thing, and there could have been more action. On the other hand, the acting was believable, the cinematography was generally pleasant, the visual effects were decent, the sets/props/costumes felt authentic, and the soundtrack was fine.",3
"3890",269,"An adequate story played by a competent actor but was just way too old for the person he was portraying which was just too distracting at times to take the movie as seriously as should be.

Sadly, the studio demanded a sequel and further misleading ""pseudo-sequels"", or reboots years later. Even though some great acting talent and directors were involved, none of the sequels worked.

Ultimately, Ivan Reitman simply makes a lot of bad pictures and this was his fluke classic, also leads Bill Murray and Harold Ramis' professional relationship deteriorated badly later in the decade and never recovered.

Perhaps the writers were trying to head off criticism that the third movie in the reboot franchise was a bit episodic, but that is what it is. Once again we have to witness the hapless new Enterprise being easily destroyed by enemy ships, this time in its entirety. What follows is an unrealistic plot where the crew is saved by a cliched alien who has conveniently commandeered an abandoned Federation ship that the Enterprise crew are able to miraculously get working again. Why does the Federation spacecraft need to fall vertically from a cliff in order to start the engines? Has any Star Trek movie or TV show previously required a flow of air through the nacelle engines in order to start them? Feels like a pointless out of cannon plot point. A silly chase scene and a zero-g punch up between Kirk and the bad guy and the movie is all over. I enjoyed the popcorn more.",3

After a 10-year pause (I'm not counting ""Legacy"" because despite being called a Bourne movie, there was no Jason Bourne in it! Just a few flashbacks [that in the end were completely unnecessary to the Legacy plot] from the end of the Ultimatum movie so that they can call it a Bourne movie), I had high hopes that they finally had come up with something new, but, NOPE! I could call everything that was going to happen because I've seen it 3 times already. Bourne tries to stay under radar; some clandestine operation is uncovered; some head honcho at the agency wants to see him dead (despite the 3 honchos before him/her failed miserably); there is always an ""asset"" in same area as Bourne who tries to kill him; Bourne uses tricky deception, misdirection (by knowing every city WAY TOO well); someone close to him gets killed; someone in the agency kills someone else in the agency (cuz that's what they do... go around killing each other); ridiculously long vehicle chase; gratuitous fight scene; incredibly accurate tracking equipment (it took us 10 years to find Bin Laden, but they can find Bourne in the most obscure area in 10 seconds); using amnesia as a method to suddenly add huge amounts of back story that they failed to think of when planning out these movies, etc., etc.",1
"3920",299,"A by-the-numbers and largely superfluous continuation of the franchise. It's not without a couple of tense sequences (the riot, the symposium), but the absence of any originality or creativity is apparent. The acting is bland and the impact of the action is largely minimized both by the merciless shaky cam and the lack of any depth to the story, as even the revelations about Bourne's past play second fiddle to the sketchy collage of predictable plot developments and standard action scenes.",3

Apart from the weak story though, it is a feast for the eyes and every frame looks like a work of art.",3
"3956",335,"Great movie. The story was really good, simple but effective. There were no unneeded scenes, the dialogue was well put together. The animation style is great, all stop motion making the attention to detail that much more insane. 100% recommend watching",5
"3957",336,"A breathtaking journey into friendship and self convictions.

Travis Knight directs Laika's stop motion animated fantasy adventure Kubo and the Two Strings (2016) with a striking patience for the melancholic, quiet moments in life as well as a spirited warmth for Kubo's odyssey through the hero's journey. Knight takes you on an emotional voyage with Kubo as you appreciate the themes of motherhood, friendship, morals, community, spirituality, and trust. Writers Chris Butler, Marc Haimes, and Shannon Tindle craft Kubo's understanding of these concepts on a deeper level as he uncovers his mysterious past. Kubo and the Two Strings is animation studio Laika's most emotionally sensitive film with a mature tone and playful childlike wonder for the world around Kubo.

I love August Hall and Alice Bird's art direction for Kubo and the Two Strings. Making a Japanese folk story into a blend of Japanese aesthetic and culture with Laika's gorgeous stop motion animation is very creative. I love the way the waves feel layered like the leaf stitched sail or the flashes of swords clashing. Kubo must have been a pain to create with such detailed stop motion work. Editor Christopher Murrie splices all this footage together with a steady pace for a brisk 102 minute adventure for any family.

Art Parkinson's sincere and sweet voice works well for Kubo, with his ability to sound concerned and empathetic to all around him. Meanwhile, Charlize Theron kills it as the tough love Monkey and tenderly earnest Mother voices. Brenda Vaccaro is funny as the elderly lady Kameyo. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and George Takei's villagers are funny like Matthew McConaughey's hilarious Beetle character that I loved tremendously. Matthew gives Beetle a whimsical nature that is laid back and works so well for his memory loss suffering samurai. Rooney Mara is incredible with her dual role as the eerie Sisters. Ralph Fiennes gets to deliver excellent and unsettling speeches to perfection as The Moon King.

Visually, Kubo and the Two Strings is Laika's most refined picture with Frank Passingham's cinematography looks gorgeous with these ultra wide shots of Kubo's rich environments guiding the film, to his more tender close-up shots of these animated characters to really see their personality and emotions. The animators line up Kubo's string playing with the music and his hands fretting the lute's neck, down to the finger movements. Kubo is certainly impressive.

Production designers Nelson Lowry and Daniel R. Casey finds a natural textured look for Kubo's village and all the forests and temples look amazing. Carl B. Hamilton and Andy Berry's set decoration has all these cute figures and furnishings in the homes to look more realistic. All the paper scrolls and bowls look so cute. The visual effects for the magic spells of the witch to the swirling paper magic of Kubo's musical numbers are wondrous. 

Composer Dario Marianelli did a fantastic job spiraling emotional melodies with exciting adventure themes through Kubo and the Two Strings. I appreciate Marianelli's varied musical stylings that have a Japanese sound to the themes, while also feeling especially cinematic. Deborah Cook's costumes look so neat for Kubo's robes to Beetle's shell armor and The Sisters' black cloaked outfits.

In all, Kubo and the Two Strings is one of Laika's best stop motion films with a resplendent humanity and sense of self. It has charm and identity that all feel unique.",5

When we see that in such sports there are only 2 places you can end up being in high places or low places when winning & defeat can place us there. When we try to reach high places where others push us down we see climbing to the top is hard to do in such places. When what place we live in we make this a place to live, grow strong, learn from others to fight and take us to the next place as our journey as fighter begins. When we see other places we wish to get in with when love takes our attention to another place we can't help but fall for. When we see in such places that have nothing to be the next best thing to always strive to be on top of this place for our people. 

When we see some places are better without us when it puts us in our place, no place. When we see we are used to turmoiled places to only stay in the safe places away from where those are fighting. When we need to make others see other ways of fighting when some places we are in we fight with our mind, heart, and fists. When we see such places we own and control we need to time right for the perfect moment. When we see in such places we can't help but not fight what places we are with those. 

When we see such places we are in are long shots when we don't have the right people to get us there. When we see such places, others can't be in when it's a place that draws large crowds and money with this who place us on top or below. When we see our moment in such place to make it on top we see we must win. When we come from a faraway place to see that we make such places proud of us when it's our country, those in our corner, fans, and family. When we see what high places gets us when winning gets us money, fame, luxury, and respect in places that we give back in what has given us.

When we see what places give that we might see and not see when it comes from those who train us, promote us, fight against us, those who make us on top then we already are and those who make us the best by our corner to take back to places we started to regain that fight. When we don't see someplaces all the fame takes us into places of greed and lust that other places don't wish to associate with. When we see we came from low places to not tarnish the sport we are in when old faces appear and show us the place we thought we were from was not other places. When we don't see what hidden distractions or misrepresentations such places can take us and others when such sports are so large that we need to get the facts straight when we need to make those a household name coming from low places to clean them up and get them back on their feet for a rematch and comeback. When such places we don't see such sports will take us when the pressures and stress of it all threatens us including the fighters we fight we wish not to return to such places again.  

When we see someplaces we don't understand when we are in no place to fight when we have no place to fight for when we have it all. When we see such places we need to leave when we see the dark places it takes others riding our coat tails to the top. When we see what low places we come to in our career when we lose to leave such places we grew up as a fighter. When we see that we still have plenty of fight in us to return to such places again and do it right. When boxing is just entering into this fandom place that many boxing greats before it have drawn crowds to see that it's a big business that is growing with large contracts that attracts everyone to such places.

All well folded together by Karel Reisz. Really good stuff.",5
"3984",363,"Terrifically oddball British New Wave comedy/drama about artist David Warner slowly losing his mind and going off the deep end when his wife, Vanessa Redgrave, plans to divorce him. There's a bit of Walter Mitty in Warner's character, but the comedy is much darker as it's clear that Warner is also losing his mind. The film seemed to start a bit slow for me, but once I got into it, I was really into it! The film is truly hilarious in parts and truly poignant in others. The gorilla suit scenes near the end were my favorite. Not a film for all tastes, but if this is your sort of thing, you're in for a treat.",4
"3985",364,"Interesting, but ridiculous. Redgrave is beautiful. Warner is mad. It was a counter culture type film that i did not especially enjoy. Especially the fascination with gorillas.

"3987",366,"Marvelously twisted, "": A Suitable Case for Treatment"" is a tale of a boyish eccentric (David Warner) who's oddly consumed with three subjects: his estranged wife Leonie (Oscar-nominated Vanessa Redgrave), jungle beasts and communism. He adds hammer-and-sickle emblems wherever he can, can't help associating random human behavior with similar animal activity and intensely plots to win back Leonie's love. None of these obsessions draw him much favor, however, and his artist's temperament begins to cross the line between whimsy and genuine dementia.

Much of the film's charm derives from the playful chemistry between  and Leonie -- Leonie is resolved to drop him for her own good, but also can't hide her delight at his uninhibited, daredevil mischief. Redgrave perfectly captures these mixed feelings in her first major role, while also managing to be exquisitely sexy. Otherwise, 's courtship hijinks -- typically involving him sabotaging the flat Leonie shares with her uptight new fiance Charles (Robert Stephens) -- are lots of fun. In one of the wildest scenes,  rigs the apartment with loudspeakers to blast music and sound effects as the couple start to make love. """"'s New Wave affectations and washed-out, black-and-white cinematography are somewhat dated (it looks even older than it is), but this is one of the decade's great cult movies.",4

"3993",372,"I'd have to be a rotten tomato myself to just turn a nose at this.

I'm writing this as I'm watching it on YouTube and I'm sincerely enjoying it very much! Besides some hilarious moments, I like that this movie showed Chinese traditions and gorgeous countryside of China which is rare in a western-released movie. Overall, it's much appreciated and since it's got scenery, adventure and laughs, I'm all for it.

As for a critique; I would say that the editing is awkward sometimes, certain predicaments are resolved without explanation or it feels some scenes were thrown in there for the sake of having a laugh. The main story also is more like a subplot to the gags.
———-
However more on the good points; 
Jackie playing the more serious and frustrated comedian is something I haven't seen him do as often and he isn't the foreigner this time, which is cool. Johnny is his usual weasely goofball self (which I love) and lived up to what I would expect. 
I find the collaboration of the two famed stunt actors very interesting and I don't think I would have imagined them together and yet it works. 

There isn't as much martial arts but, I don't mind it so much as long as there is plenty of great scenes and there were indeed.

Funny moments out of context: 
1) Bennie (Jackie) holding the matryoshka doll and lady punching it….
2) Connor (Johnny) points and says ""Are those what we are trying to make?""",4
"3994",373,"I could certainly see people not caring about this movie if all they saw were the first 20-25 minutes - while they're not exactly bad, they're hardly quality either.  However, the movie does become somewhat endearing after a bit, and while hardly among Jackie's best in terms of comedy or action, it does a decent job with both.  It doesn't hurt that Rennie Harlon directs this movie with a solid pace, and some parts of the movie look wonderful.  It's also not too long, and while Johnny Knoxville has made a career of being professionally obnoxious, he actually shows a more modest and likeable side here, once he and Chan start to see things on each other's levels.  If you're a Jackie Chan fan and you have a free afternoon, I'd recommend giving it a viewing -- It's inoffensive entertainment, and a lot better than some of his other more recent movies, such as The Medallion and The Myth.",3

This film should never have been made, the only two worthwhile performances in the entire disaster were by Peter Sarsgaard (the bad guy), and 
Vincent D'Onofrio, who found an interesting angle as a god-fearing mountain-man (hence the extra half star).

"4052",431,"First off, I want to start with a positive: the voice cast. Everyone does an amazing job voicing their characters. I would say that this is the highlight of the movie. It was also great to see an actual voice actor in the lead role. A big problem with a lot of these modern animated movies is that studios go with bigger names who don't have much experience in the field of voice acting. So I was really happy to see Katie Crown in a lead role and do such an amazing job. Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key are also such fun in their roles and give such life to Beta and Alpha. The world-building in this movie was quite nice as well. The colorful and bright animation contributes to that aspect a lot. Stork Mountain and the Cornerstore warehouse are also very imaginative and have lots of fun components to them. Nicholas Stoller deserves some credit for that because he came up with a very fun story. Although, his writing wasn't perfect. The biggest problem I had with  is how it handled its characters, two characters specifically. First off we have Junior who is a great character and had a lot of fun quips and jokes. However, I feel that his character development felt a little rushed and unfocused. For instance, Junior starts off getting offered the role of boss and he's excited about it. Then they start to give clues that he is not really sure why he wants to be boss which was a great setup for a new endeavor. However, we never get to see what happened to him or even dialogue explaining his next step forward. It makes it even worse that he is one of the main characters. The other character I had a problem with is Pigeon Toady who I found to have the worst overarching story out of all the characters. His goals and actions feel so random and they don't have a strong set-up. Pigeon Toady becoming the villain felt like it came out of nowhere. I think the main problem with that is of course the writing, but also the short runtime that is under 90 minutes. I would have loved for the movie to have been a bit longer to flesh out the characters a bit more. Even though the writing and directing could have been a bit better, I found  to be very enjoyable. With its fun humor, interesting story, and stellar voice cast,  will definitely treat viewers to an exciting and entertaining adventure. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",4

"4059",438,"No one gets society like Warner Brothers Animation. Cartoon Network shows like Adventure Time and Steven Universe handle equality and representation, We Bare Bears and Regular Show handle(d) millennial culture and how technology impacts all of us, and on the big screen  addresses a little bit of both, corporate culture (including what an empire Amazon is becoming) and workaholism. If it sounds like The WB isn't making content for kids anymore, don't worry, they are and  is a return to that and a bit of their former looney-ness.


 answers the age-old question of where babies come from. Someone writes a letter to the stork, the baby factory automates the entire process, and  deliver the bundles of joy. At least they used to. This was a failing business model, to say the least, but when a little boy asks for a little sibling (with ninja skills), and the baby factory is accidentally turned on it's, up to our main stork Junior (Andy Samberg) and his human co-worker Tulip (Katie Crown) to brush off that old employee handbook and go on an adventure.

The adventure is told at a fairly fast pace, if only because some of the dialogue is either a little expositional or on the nose. If these moments stretched the film out, it could've been painful. For instance, they have a locker room scene that demonstrates how career-focused Junior is, but they could've cut it and taken him almost directly to meeting his boss CEO Hunter (Kelsey Grammer) and no ounce of his character would've been lost. Instead, what we get is some reflective 21st Century water-cooler talk. It's so bad it's good, featuring a brown-nosing bro-pigeon (Stephen Kramer Glickman). It's something straight out of a ""What Not To Do"" LinkedIn article, and it's wonderful. A lot of the film is like that, with ridiculous profit charts, figuring out what being a boss means, and in-office golfing.

Anyway, out of the office, and in the suburbs, a couple of the same rules apply. That little boy, Nate (Anton Starkman) is the son of two workaholic parents (Ty Burrell, being very Phil Dunphy, and Jennifer Aniston, who doesn't do enough voice work). This sounds familiar, but  sets itself apart from most films by showing their whole home life, and not the parents' work life against Nate's home life. A baby isn't expected to magically just fix things if it shows up at the door.

The voice cast isn't just remarkable by name-recognition alone. In addition to those mentioned, Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key are the baby-loving wolves Alpha and Beta, and Danny Trejo as Jasper one of the last of the baby-delivering .

Alpha and Beta, and their pack are something special. In pursuit of the baby, the comedy dream team of Key and Peele will form Voltron-like Wolf-Vehicles and objects by linking themselves together. This is straight out of Saturday-morning cartoons, and exactly what WB fans would expect...What they won't expect, however, is these beautiful, silly visuals were created by Sony.

Sony Imageworks, who has created some of the most photorealistic CGI in the last twenty-five years, animated this entire film. It's shocking until you see the one sequence the filmmakers decide to replay. Everything else is gorgeously built from scratch and Imageworks, even with nothing to prove, showed that old wolves could learn some fun tricks. The visuals are fast and cartoony. Hopefully, when Warners Brothers starts making CGI in-house, they marry their legacy with what Imageworks has blessed them with.

Finally, one note about the sound. The film's score, by Mychael and Jeff Danna, occasionally uses a comedic orchestra. This is usually a pretty funny gag, and most likely it typically uses stock audio.  does it more than once, and it's a surefire hit each time. More than likely these were fresh recordings, and when thinking about it, it sounds more and more like this film was a real collaborative experience for those involved.

If you can ignore the unintentional existential questions about overpopulation and unwanted children this film raises (just bury it deep down in the dark corners of the mind), enjoy .",4

"4064",443,"Based on a true story, the film Deepwater Horizon was released in September of 2016. The story the movie told was the event of the industrial disaster that was the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Deepwater Horizon oil rig operating on the Gulf of Mexico exploded and sank, causing the death of 11 workers on the drilling site. Around 4 million barrels of oil flowed into the ocean over an 87-day period, making it the largest marine oil spill in history.  

	Since the film was to be based on a true story, the director of the film, Peter Berg, made sure to make this disaster movie as accurate as possible. The story mainly focuses on the character of Mike Williams, who was the chief electrical technician on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. The beginning of the movie focuses a lot on what exactly went wrong at the time of the explosion. The main character, Williams, is seen having a conversation with an offshore manager, Harrell, as he explains the technical problems that they're experiencing on the rig. Williams notes that 10% of all their systems are down, yet Harrell goes ahead with the test of all equipment. This test is what eventually triggers the explosion of the rig. The workers going about their day-to-day routine are shown when everything goes wrong. After that point, the film is filled with intense and suspenseful action as the workers try to make it out and save their lives. 

	Quite an emotional yet powerful film that was able to reflect the dangers of working on an oil rig perfectly. The beginning of the film is quite difficult to follow for the average watcher; someone who has never worked on an oil rig. The writers did not shy away from any technical language that would normally be used between two coworkers in this situation. When Williams was explaining was exactly was wrong and all the technical problems, it's not easy to understand or comprehend at all what he meant. However, the main point is still able to get across to the audience; the rig is in no position to run any sort of tests and the company is wrong to rush it after falling behind. The explosion scene itself was perfectly disastrous, the sound and visual effects did not disappoint either. The ignition of the massive fireball was shown at its very beginning stage and it was shown moving continuously throughout the entire rig. The scene was almost horrifying, the scenes were cut together to show the fear of each of the workers at the time of the explosion. There was no heroism from one specific character, no big spiels or grand gestures from anyone, the film wasn't meant for that. After the explosion, it was straight chaos as the workers fought for their own lives to make it out. Some sacrifices were made for colleagues helping one another, but no one person is able to save the day in this kind of disaster. While it may have felt like a thriller movie, Berg wasn't intending to make a thriller, he wanted to show a story as accurately as possible and I think he did just that. Berg sacrificed no realism in order to create this film. He throws the audience directly in the middle of the disaster, following around the workers as they attempt to make it out alive. The explosion creates massive and unbearable flames, destruction, and disaster. The following scenes after are just as suspenseful as the beginning of the explosion.  

The acting in this movie was incredible and overall, the film was casted very well. In my opinion, each of the characters were able to play their part perfectly while showing true emotions; the anger, shock, fear, and sadness were perfectly portrayed by each character. The visual effects were stunning, the dramatic explosion scene was truly terrifying yet somehow still beautiful. The sound effects were everything one would expect to hear during an oil rig explosion. Berg truly captured this horrible yet true disaster. 

The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was the largest marine industrial disaster to ever occur. Berg showcasing this was an educational yet emotional experience for many people. The film is definitely a highly accurate representation of the actual event on the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. However, the beginning of the movie creates some confusion for general audience members. The audience never really gets to understand what exactly went wrong and why the rig ended up exploding. The story shows the disaster but doesn't exactly focus on the comprehensive points of the reason for disaster. Regardless, the film is an incredible watch and I would recommend it. 4.5/5.",5

Although the film incorporates some musical traditions and hints of customary practices and beliefs of the people it attempts to represent, one feels almost that the story could have taken place anywhere.

'Queen of Katwe' is another Disney sports biopic, but one made with a difference - it doesn't hit the exact same notes as the studio usually does in this genre, which is a positive. The film is shot lovely, with a terrific main cast.

Lupita Nyong'o is top notch in the role of Nakku, while Madina Nalwanga impresses in the lead as Phiona. David Oyelowo would be my personal standout, he's terrific as Robert, but all three add a great deal to the film to be fair. A few of the child actors give good support performances, also.

It does slightly suffer with the fact its story revolves around chess, which isn't the most exciting or massively interesting game/sport to watch across 124 minutes. However, it's about much more than just chess - it features a big life story too. It does a grand job at making you care for the individuals onscreen.

"4080",459,"Mira Nair's ""Queen of Katwe"" is a moving, heartfelt and inspirational sports drama that overcomes genre clichés through powerful filmmaking. With her latest feature, director Mira Nair has crafted an astonishing biopic about the little-known African Chess prodigy Phiona Mutesi. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to bring a true story of an African girl to the big-screen, but she pulls it off seamlessly. Using captivating cinematography, Nair draws viewers into the world of an African chess champion chasing her dreams. From intimate close-ups to gorgeous establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's Ugandan setting. Nair excels at recreating the impoverished conditions of Uganda, even though she is not from the country. In terms of acting, the entire ensemble is at the top of its game. Lupita Nyong'o delivers one of the best performances of her career as Nakku. With fierce expressions, he conveys the fear, insecurities and protective nature of a mother raising her children in impoverished conditions. David Oyelowo is equally excellent in the role of Phiona's motivational chess coach. Although ""Queen of Katwe"" is undeniably uplifting, ultimately it is not a flawless film. Its story is slightly formulaic, and follows the safe conventions of the genre. Moreover, it builds to the predictable conclusion that we've come to expect from films in the genre. Nevertheless, fans of sports dramas will definitely enjoy ""Queen of Katwe"" and so will movie-goers seeking inspiring entertainment. At a time when the world has never heard of Phiona Mutesi, it's a stirring reminder that the stories of African wunderkinds are worth retelling on the big-screen.",4

"4092",471,"An interesting story, with tons of questions and few answers. Well told but nothing exceptional.",3
"4093",472,"""La Fille du RER"" or ""The Girl on the Train"" is a tough nut to crack.  On one side, it's a tidy, neat treat from the delicious tastes of French cinema; yet on the other, it's a film that raises a potentially very compelling and controversial topic but merely glosses over it and does just about nothing with it.  It's hard to discredit it completely though, because it does have Catherine Deneuve in a leading role, and the talent of André Téchiné at the helm.
	The film focuses on Jeanne (Émilie Dequenne), a pretty but troubled young woman who floats aimlessly throughout life, with her supportive mother (Deneuve) always in the wings.  Jeanne's life suddenly becomes a little more exciting when brooding wrester/thug Franck (Nicolas Duvaunchelle) charms her.  She moves in with them, they begin dating, and then they get a sweet gig working as caretakers for a warehouse that actually is filled with drugs (which is unknown to Jeanne).  After Franck is stabbed by an impatient junkie, Jeanne barely escapes getting arrested, and even worse, Franck wants nothing to do with her.  If we didn't know Jeanne was fragile before, now we do, because suddenly, after hearing many stories similar on TV, she fabricates a story in which a group of strangers attack her because they believe she's Jewish.  But why does she do it?
	At one glance, ""La Fille du RER"" works well in the sense that it's realistic, and it makes for a somewhat involving piece of drama.  Téchiné directs every scene with style and flair, but never overdoes it, while the score is unsettling but just as mysterious as the characters themselves.  From a technical standpoint, the film is gorgeous, but it doesn't have much more to offer than that.
	Dequenne and Deneuve are both excellent though; Dequenne manages to make Jeanne seem a bit troubled without ever once overdoing it, while Deneuve it heartbreaking as the caring mother that doesn't know how to deal with the mess her daughter has made.  They make use of what little they have to work with, and it's disappointing they couldn't have been in a better film than this.
	The pacing and story just feels imbalance-- almost 3/4 of the film are taken just to explain the relationship between Jeanne and Franck, and Jeanne and her mother, and how it could have molded her into a crazed mess.  By the time the actual ""hate-crime"" idea comes along, there's a mere half-hour left, which doesn't give the viewer any time to fully absorb what's happening.  The topic itself it subtly skimmed over, and resolved so quickly that hardly any drama occurs.  Everything in the film feels way undercooked-- even with just twenty more minutes, it could've broadened its ideas a little bit and eventually become a better film.  But instead, it's stuck in a world where style comes over substance.
	""La Fille du RER"" is a decent French thriller, but it isn't as good as it should be, considering the subject matter.  Only for the biggest fans of either Deneuve or Téchiné, or both.",3

The use of different camera movements, changing between hand held, long shots and close ups are used to create intense drama. Also, the repetition of imagery and even use of dual exposure creates a visual emotional language that communicates the drama in this film. It is based on an actual case, although adapted. The performances are good especially Emilie Dequenne as Jeanne, creating an intense emotional narrative, that like most French films leaves much open and ambiguous and thus all the more interesting.

Which, you know, tend to be the main selling point of a frickin' superhero movie, even in origin stories. Only one proper fight happens and that's near the end with minimal superheroics before that. No saving somebody from getting run over or the hero using some random criminal lowlifes as target practice, just stuff about a psychic connection while the actor screams and keeps telling his crush/girlfriend ""I'm sorry, I have to go"". I'd have hoped that Mattel's attempt to start their own toy-based movie franchise might have been raked over the coals hard by critics but sadly I have to agree that, if it weren't for it being immediately forgotten, lacking anything to help it stand out in a genre that, by the time this movie came out, was understandably being increasingly met with concerns that it would be in danger of getting oversaturated and dying a quiet death at the box office, it could easily have qualified as unequivocally one of the worst superhero movies of all time.",1

From the very beginning, we get acquainted with the girl's daddy issue. Little by little, we enter the confusing world for which her therapist prepared us, reciting the reason for her stuttering in the first few minutes. The whole construction of her image is based on the belief that radical politics and the (in that case way too radical) actions it sometimes implies presuppose some confusion, some deviation from the normalcy, some alienation from everyday life.

On the contrary, it is based on the dismantling of the confusion, on undressing of normality and revealing it as what it is, on being present within the lived life, its conditions and the unacceptable limitations that it imposes on human potential.

I don't know how someone will put this into the ""Most Popular Leftist Radical Movies and TV Shows"" list. This movie belongs in the ""Most Popular Reactionist Movies and TV Shows"".

"4127",506,"Threw on the movie the night I finished the book, and while Roth's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is something special, the movie is not nearly as dreadful as those RT ratings have it: (22/29). A few aspects of the plot needed to be cut for the film, as they always do, and besides the ending, nothing major was changed. Merry, (Ocean James, Hannah Nordberg, and Dakota Fanning) transforms from a cute, precocious, stuttering little girl into a repugnant, hyper-political, domestic terrorist by the age of sixteen. And I don't say that lightly. Merry is truly one of my favorite characters to hate in all of literature. While her main cause is noble, protesting the Vietnam War, she directs her antipathy toward her parents'/society's way of life and ultimately kills four innocent people. Perhaps she would've been slightly more sympathetic, had her parents been pro-war, racist, greedy capitalists, but they are far from it, both coming from humble backgrounds and overtly stating their objections to the war. Seymour ""Swede"" Levov (Ewan McGregor) was a star high school athlete (Side note: As a native of Essex County, NJ, I would've appreciated if they'd googled Weequahic's colors to see they are Orange and Brown, not Red and Black, but at least they got the mascot correct) who took up his father's glove-making business, one of the last functional businesses in Newark, remaining long after the 1967 riots, much longer than they should have. Swede is the American Dream incarnate, even more so in the film as his affair is cut from the novel, if anything coming off as too forgiving, too understanding, too gullible, too slow to take action. Eventually, Swede's own words come back to haunt him, as he tells Merry to ""be productive and protest the war at home,"" which she does… by blowing up a little post office in her bucolic hometown. Dawn (Jennifer Connelly), a former Miss New Jersey, born and raised in Elizabeth, a city similar to Newark, but with even less industry these days, has done everything possible to escape her pageant past, even compensating by working with farm animals, reminding everyone that she was only in it for the scholarship. The film leaves Rita Cohen (Valorie Curry) as much of a mystery as she is in the novel, which was one of the parts I most disliked in both, but Fanning and Curry pull-off the white, dense, spoiled, smug, nauseatingly uber-liberal ""revolutionaries"" perfectly. Where the film could've really improved was when Swede confronts Merry, hiding from the FBI — in Newark of all places — fully converted to the Jain religion. These scenes are pivotal to the novel and lacked the emotion I was expecting and looking forward to in the film. While they included her mouth — her vile, disgusting mouth hidden behind her veil — the description in the book is so vivid and McGregor didn't seem to flinch at the stench; a stench the readers all experienced during that chapter. The ending was the biggest difference, with the intent, I suppose, to make a friendlier, more cathartic ending for the viewer, but… ehh. Should've had her arrested then if wanted to go that route. Roth's novel is dark through and through and I think had the film followed suit, it would've been more respected. I still put it in the recommends, it's a fantastic story, but if you want to experience it completely, read the book, you won't be disappointed.",4

It's not exactly ground-breaking, but it does cycle through a lot of the questions that agnostics and atheists might have asked and offers explanations and evidence. How convincing it is, well, that's another thing entirely and is going to depend on what you believed going in: for Christians, it has the potential to be a sentimental and emotional journey that echoes a lot of what they've likely been through themselves; for everyone else, results will probably vary -- many will feel they're still being preached to and won't like that, others might question the so-called evidence and go and look it up for themselves.

The movie was well made and kept my attention.  I don't imagine I'll watch this again, but it was worth my time to see it once.  Very nice acting from everyone here. ",4

The tow giant actors hold back their comedic antics and deliver a punch that will pay off for most. And Strasberg just delivers his magic.

"4149",20,"Writer/Director Martin Brest had a really good track record as a director, but sadly has a rather short filmography. This was his second film, which he followed with ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" ""Midnight Run"" and ""Scent of a Woman."" His last film was the notorious flop ""Gigli"" which Brest battle the studio on and the film extensively changed form his original version. Re-watching this early film of his, I'm really wanting to see a new film from him. Telling the unusual comic crime story about a group of three elderly men, George Burns, Art Carney, and Lee Strasberg, deciding to become bank robbers. I think what distinguishes Breast crime comedies from other inferior ones is that he always invests time to character development. There are plenty of examples where comic crime films are merely funny or clever (i.e. ""Oceans 11,"" ""My Blue Heaven,"" ""Get Shorty"" or even ""Raising Arizona"") but there are far fewer with well defined characters who the audience genuinely care about  (i.e. ""Bottle Rocket"" or ""The Sting"") who are not broad comic characters. But in addition to Breast, a huge amount of credit need to go to Burns, Carney and Strasberg, who all give believable, touching and also quite funny performances. Look fast for Mark Margolis plays a prison guard.",4

However, the monsters don't appear until some 20 years later when the humans are all grown up. This all just happens without explanation. And it's not fanciful or happening in anyone's imagination as that's made evident throughout the movie. Finally, the monsters are controlled from the sand in the play area of a park in the states. What the monsters were doing before they appeared or when they're not being controlled from the sandbox, anyone's guess.

Hathaway as Gloria is pitch perfect as a good-hearted but disaster of a human trying to get her life together. And, Jason Sudeikis is genuinely scary as her childhood friend whose motives are never quite understood but surely unsavory.

Oh yes, and there are monsters, which can be controlled by these characters when they stand in a particular spot at a particular time in a particular park of a fictional town in New England.

"4170",41,"The Fate of the Furious isn't satisfied wnith just jumping the shark: it launches itself over a nuclear submarine. Although the action starts in familiar street racing territory, it soon becomes apparent just how silly things are about to get, with Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) throwing himself from a speeding, burning car (going in reverse) onto a concrete surface and rising to his feet unscathed (whereas you and I would be a tattered mess of broken bones and mangled flesh). It's quite clear that this is going to be a cartoonish popcorn action flick with no regard for logic, but if you're able to park your brain for a couple of hours, it can be a lot of fun.

The plot concerns a cyberterrorist called Cipher (Charlize Theron) who forces Dom to work for her, threatening to kill his ex-lover and their baby son if he doesn't co-operate. Cipher orders Dom to steal an EMP device and some codes for Russian nukes, which will be used to hold the world to ransom. Meanwhile, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) assembles a team (the usual characters) to try and stop this from happening.

All of this is an excuse for numerous spectacular action set-pieces which involve vehicular carnage on a massive scale and some brutal hand to hand combat, and as a slam bang slice of mindless cinema it certainly impresses, director F. Gary Gray conducting the special effects laden mayhem with aplomb. Standout scenes include a jailbreak in which Hobbs and fellow prisoner Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) bust some heads, the 'nuclear football' heist in NYC that sees cars raining from skyscrapers, and the crazy finale in which the aforementioned nuclear sub threatens to crush our heroes (one moment involving a Lamborghini door had me laughing out loud at its sheer preposterousness).

Clearly, I am not alone in appreciating the silliness of this series, given the film's box-office success, and the fact that there is already a ninth film in production (as well as a spin off due later this year). As long they keep the craziness going, I'll be watching.",4

But the tame in comparison opening race is far superior, than a horde of hacked cars or the submarine battle. Bigger and louder just doesn't always mean more impressive. Even the best fight is just tame (in comparison) break out of Hobbs and Shaw from the prison. Charlize Theron is there, with her dreadlocks, hamming it up. Also clearly leaning towards a supervillain, than anything else. As for majority of the sidecast. It's is clear that the script hasn't came up with anything for them to do.

While living at an extravagant lifestyle, her husband wants her to meet some of her best friends she has met since high school,  in which she tries to explain she is the reason why she goes to Paris. What happens next is a series of chances involving a broken down car and a passerby driver agreeing to give her a lift.  First movie directed by Luis Malle.",3
"4261",132,"I'll start by saying this is a gorgeous film, with many beautiful scenes and fantastic 'New Wave' direction from Louis Malle.  Jeanne Moreau plays a married woman with a disinterested husband (Alain Cuny), and, bored after 8 years of marriage, pursues an affair with a polo player (José Luis de Vilallonga).  She does it under the guise of visiting her friend (Judith Magre) in Paris.  This get a little ticklish when her husband starts to tire of the charade, and demands that she invite the two of them to dinner at their mansion in Dijon.  The romantic tension in the film is palpable, and it's chic and stylish in its exploration of the age old theme of human relationships.   There is an additional character who comes on the scene of Moreau's car breakdown (Jean-Marc Bory) who provides the film a voice for criticism about French society and the bourgeois.

There is an extraordinary change of pace in what happens that night, but I won't spoil it, and it's best to not know what's coming when seeing this film for the first time.  I'll just say that it enters a bit of a dreamlike and surreal haze, but as anyone who has ever been passionately in love will attest, that haze is quite realistic.  In one highly charged scene, Moreau's lover goes down on her, which is bit shocking for 1958, a time when Hollywood by contrast was mired in the Hays Code and had married couples sleeping in separate beds.  And yet it's tastefully and beautifully done, which is perhaps that's why Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart so famously said of this film that it was not pornography, because ""I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.""  Indeed.

There is a lot to love here.  Moreau is wonderful, so beautiful and conveying so much emotion with her eyes.  The acting is strong throughout, and the film still feels like a 'fresh voice' almost 60 years later.  It's very romantic and yet honest at the same time, which is not easy.   Great film.",5
"4262",133,"It certainly foreshadows what came of Malle's cinematic style, but in this one the good performances and excellent script can't completely make up for the cliched love story and underwhelming conflicts.",3
"4263",134,"From IMDB's Trivia Section:

<i>""After screening this film, Nico Jacobellis, manager of the Heights Art Theater in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, was charged with and convicted of possessing and exhibiting an obscene film. He appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court, which overturned the convictions, ruling that the film was not obscene. In a concurring opinion, Justice Potter Stewart made his famous pronouncement concerning what was pornography: ""I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that."" Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 197 (1964) (Stewart, J., concurring).""</i>

When I saw Godard's <i>A Married Woman</i> (1964), I thought it was the first film to portray the intimacy of an affair from such a passionate and human point of view, like a humble love letter to the irrationalities of the soul and the pleasures of the flesh.

Naturally, I was wrong.

The controversy that <i>Les Amants</i> achieved in such a conservative decade like the 50s (that is not a criticism) was just a secondary consequence. I always find it interesting to talk about the perceptions of on-screen sexuality considering the decade as a dependent variable, taking the films as independent variables, because they are simply done in the way they are, assuming complete independence from the censors (I take this assumption because of the intentions of the scandalous and equally revolutionary New Wave movements all around the world, especially France, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Japan). Our perception of what constitutes pornography or obscenity is entirely dependent on our moral formation, which is dictated by society since your birth. Our life and human interactions are an endlessly, nonstop, complex amalgamation of teachings, stimula, free will, impositions and own judgment. What is taken today as maybe daring or bold, even tame, was considered obscene 50 years ago: that's what I find fascinating. That's the topic that opens a debate that I would like to call: ""Society's permissive nature is causing its own destruction VS. Society is progressively more open-minded to alternate means of expression"". Maybe we're in the middle but always want to take one extreme side: ""I am either black or white"". So, between the two things that I mentioned in the VS. showdown, which one would better explain our increasing tolerance to the portrayal of violence, sex and profanity in mainstream releases?

So what constitutes obscenity or pornography? Is it the graphic content or is it the entire connotation? Was it made to arouse or is there a full story behind that is not seeking opportunities to portray sex at every corner? Or is it both? That takes me to the flawless, thought-provoking, extraordinary, iconoclast erotic masterpiece <i>In the Realm of the Senses</i> (1976). I remember this guy saying: ""Stop with this pornography vs. art debate! It is obviously both!"" I loved how this person was convinced of his own perception being the truth and nothing but the truth, as if taking a middle stance was so easy. Of course, I entirely disagreed. The graphic content was there, but the film's aims were entirely different: to explore the human condition through a <b>true-story</b> examination of physical extremes attached to a human man-woman relationship with a meaningful political background to subliminally suggest the impositions of human behavior. Ôshima was a genius.

Cinema is an art form, and therefore, all of its stories are too regardless of how they are portrayed, from heartfelt dramas to exploitation of any kind. Malle is no provocateur - which still would make him an artist in the full definition of the word. However, he believes in the power of imagery. A correctly placed image can communicate too much. If you employ the basic aspects of storytelling as effective companions, then you have a winner. Cinematography here couldnt be better: in fact, it is one of the best in the history of cinema, I dare to say. The camera is a master of the characters' fate, including their future uncertainty.  That's precisely the film's most brilliant twist: Jeanne is a woman who ends up with no regrets, but yet with a disturbing self-discovery of her persona, completely afraid about the future, but eager to know what the future has prepared for both, even if it is disaster.

<i>Les Amants</i> is as honest as the straightforwardness of the title. There is no hidden message or implied allegory. It is a story about lovers, about how everything began, and the frustrating events preceding such a steamy, torrid affair. I was in love with the imagery even if I never sympathized with what I was seeing from a moral point of view. I believe in faithfulness being a component of true love, and I believe in the internal and external stability that faithfulness brings along. God bless the life of Jeanne Moreau, an extraordinary actress who had the guts to do what nobody would have done in commercial cinema.

"4265",136,"Louis Malle's first feature is more conservative than the typical French New Wave classic, but it's an impressive, polished debut. The glaring problem is that the first half is far more interesting than the second.

She escapes her joyless life with steady trips to Paris, where she sees her socialite friend Maggy and a polo-playing paramour. The subtle tensions between these characters are engrossing, but the film sinks once Jeanne meets another man and the story turns into a gooey, dreamy-eyed romance based on no obvious chemistry or motive.

"4272",143,"Meu nome é Ray não é um filme ruim, mas está longe de extrair todo potencial do tema. 

Aqui temos como gênero drama cômico, e até então não há nada de errado nisso, pois há filmes como O Lobo de Wallstreet, dirigido por Martin Scorsese, que mesmo tendo um lado cômico mais acentuado que este próprio filme, não peca em trabalhar temas como Abuso de drogas, prostituição, lifestyle da vida de um corretor e não ficam devendo na profundidade de cada personagem ali apresentado - é muito importante ressaltar isso, pois devemos desvincular a ideia de que uma obra cômica não pode se aprofundar sobre seus temas e personagens. Aqui, a diretora escolhe não levar a obra tão a sério, e como consequência não há verossimilhança, não acreditamos que o que estamos vendo é real, logo fica dificílimo se pôr no lugar dos personagens, pois não há um estudo de personagem convincente e muitas coisas parecem convenientes pro roteiro funcionar, como a garota que o protagonista gosta falando que deve ser horrível baterem numa *garota* e logo depois sumir da trama, ou seu pai relevando algo pesadíssimo justo no momento que o filme precisava. Fora o alívio cômico que a dupla de Susan Sarandon e Linda Emond fazem o filme todo, o que nos leva a pensar ""poxa, se a vó dela não está levando a situação a sério, fazendo piadas o tempo todo, porque eu deveria levar?""

E tudo isso que eu falei leva a um problema estrutural que é recorrente nas produções da Netflix e assola esse filme, que é estar direcionado a um nicho. O que limita seu poder de passar o conhecimento a frente e apenas conta coisas que o público alvo já sabe. O real problema é que quando o filme tenta dispor de temas tão complexos de maneira tão artificial, como a transexualidade, a falta de um pai na vida de uma criança - ou a diversidade de uma família - e o impacto que isso trás ao seu psicológico é que a se abre uma margem para más interpretações por parte de quem nunca teve um contato com os temas propostos, se tornando um desserviço.",2
"4273",144,"Storyline was decent but the main character puts off the whole movie. He doesn't think about anyone but himself and puts everyone out to be the bad person.",2
"4274",145,"Directed by Gaby Dellal and produced in 2017, Three Generations is an amazing movie for anyone and everyone to watch. In my opinion, this movie is amazing because it has comedic aspects tied in, when things need to be serious, they portray that very well. I really liked how they follow the main character, Ray and his family along throughout his journey and transition.  

 

Three Generations shows the everyday life of a transgender teen struggling with his transition. Not only does it show what it's like for the one who's transitioning, but it also shows how the family goes through their child's transition along with them. It accurately depicts the up and downs of transitioning and really shows how hard it is on the kid and his family. This is the perfect movie for someone to watch if they, themselves are going through a transition, or even for parents of a transgender child to watch.  

 

I love how this movie doesn't only show the good and positive things about transitioning, but it also shows how hard it can be on both them and their families. It shows everything that goes into being transgender, the good and the bad. It doesn't shy away from showing the bad things like bullying. There was really only one thing I wish they would have done different.  

 

There's a scene where Ray is in a bathroom. He removes his shirt and it shows he's binding his chest with ace bandages. This is a very, very dangerous thing to do. This movie will obviously attract transgender teens, especially female to male trans teens. If someone was watching this and saw that as a healthy way of binding without knowing any better, they could get seriously injured. The injuries that come along with this can be fatal at times. I just think they could've showed a better way of binding, keeping in mind the type of people this movie was easily going to attract.  

 

I think people should definitely go and watch this. It's the perfect movie for someone to watch, whether they are transitioning, or have a child who is transgender or just want to educate themselves. It makes a lot of things easier to understand and shows the kid's point of view and struggles. I think it's important for people to watch movies like this to get a better understanding of what being trans is like. Not only so they know what it is and can understand better, but so they can be there if they know people that are transgender, so they can know how to help their friends. This is an amazing movie for anyone of any age to watch.  ",5

Not once did I feel like ""Ray,"" nee ""Ramona,"" was a fully formed person, which is a shame, becuse Fanning is absolutely capable of it.

Sarandon sucks the energy out of the film and the other two adult women barely matter when she's on-screen.

And, sadly,  the ending goes to show that past behavior is a prediction of future behavior. At least when it comes to what motivates him to be with his wife.

The other characters are all viewed through his eyes so we only get a one sided view of the lives they are leading, including those of his family.  At it's core, it's a character study of a manipulative self centred man who believes the world owes him something, very rarely realising that his situation is of his own making.

"4340",211,"Really solid drama with great acting.",4
"4341",212,"A well made Gothic period drama.

Henry Koster's atmospheric direction is excellent for his moody period drama My Cousin Rachel (1952). Koster knows how to pull performances out of people that are effective. All of Joseph LaShelle's  black and white cinematography is striking with shadows everywhere in a dark manor. 

I love Daphne du Maurier's writing about a conniving woman playing men for their fortunes and a miserable young man overzealous in his affections and suspicious about his love. Nunnally Johnson's script is poignant, yet fun as he plays with language and conversation with underlying meanings to every word. I liked Franz Waxman's melodic and dreary score that gives My Cousin Rachel a bleak vibe.

Olivia de Havilland is quite pretty and intriguing as the manipulative and charming Mrs. Rachel Sangalletti Ashley. Havilland excels at expressing Rachel's true feelings with a screw of her mouth, a quick pout, or a roll of the eyes. Richard Burton is intense, sympathetic, manic, and over the top as Philip Ashley. He's rightfully accusatory, but then goes overboard in his zeal for love. Burton plays Philip quite well. 

Audrey Dalton is absolutely gorgeous as Louise Kendall in My Cousin Rachel and honestly prettier than Olivia de Havilland. She's a neat foil for Burton to converse with as they ruminate, discuss, and contemplate Rachel's schemes.

Everyone else is rather forgettable and conventional. I liked this movie, but I wanted to love it. It's so technically well made, but for a 98 minute long movie, it does have some boring parts. It could have been edited with more of a flair to keep me more engaged. I love the lead performances and music score though.

In all, My Cousin Rachel is a classic that mostly holds up to contemporary standards.",4

It's a touching film whether you're a dog owner or not, but if you have or have had a pupper in your life, you can imagine what Leavey is going through and you might just find yourself tearing up more than once -- that's its greatest strength.",4

"4358",229,"Lassie goes to Iraq. But that slight similarity aside, this is a moving film that animal-lovers and people-lovers alike will love. Not as intense as some films about Iraq or war more generally, given the subject matter is the bond between a soldier and her explosive-sniffing dog. But it does portray well the bonds that people can form with animals, especially under such stressful conditions, and the pain of PTSD. And in some ways that lack of relative intensity is appealing, in that the film shows the danger of battle and the situation U.S. soldiers encountered there, without completely immersing the viewer in it.

The suspension of disbelief is not as high in this film as in the second in the franchise. The growth of McQueen as a character through the films (at least the first one and this film) is deeply appreciated. Pixar ups their game in animation for this film. The lighting, particle effects and water are all more realistic. Larry the Cable Guy is better utilized in this film, in fact I could have used more of him as Mater. It was also nice to hear Paul Newman's voice from unused recordings from the first movie. I think this movie is worth your time.",3

Taken in and tended to by the headmistress and the students, he soon becomes a focal point for the sexual interests of the women in what becomes a battle of gender politics.  As always, director Sofia Coppola has a firm grasp of her material and patiently lets the inevitable battle for McBurney's affections play out.  The exteriors are beautifully shot in natural light, but the same natural light tends to muddy the interior shots making the characters, at times, difficult to identify.  It's an interesting remake of the original Don Siegel film from 1971 and worth watching for fans of Coppola's other films.",4

Colin Farrell taking Clint Eastwood's place in a remake nearly half a century on could have been a slight risk, and I do think that he finds it difficult to land his character arc after quite a tranquil introduction, but if he is the weakness then it is only due to the strength of those around him. Fanning, Kidman, and Dunst all perform superbly. Sofia Coppola's visual eye remains evident in many of the scenes to set such a rich, dark atmosphere. A criticism that I had of The Bling Ring was the vapid characters and a lazy-eyed lack of investment in the story that it attempted to sell, but I found that The Beguiled featured a Coppola-written screenplay that managed to capture characters with just enough backstories and revealing moments to allow for intrigue rather than frustrated detachment. Be it for the exploration of a stereotypical male fantasy bound to go horribly wrong from the off or decent source material before it, this film shapes its elements into the best of Coppola that I have seen to this point.",4

"4447",318,"Baby Driver (2017) is another purely satisfying movie done by non-other than the king of visual-comedy himself Edgar Wright.

Wright once more does an incredible job with a sub-genre ( car chasing action/thrillers) that is becoming more and more repetitive and boring. With amazing visuals, great storytelling, which is very uncommon in this type of movies, and a sizzling musical work, he creates one hell of a ride of a movie that is entertaing from begginng to end.

The cast was perfectly chosen and Ansel Elgort was actually very likeable here. Foxx and Spacey were super fly and Lily James was delighful.

Baby Driver has to be one of the best edited movies I've seen in a while. Every sound fits perfectly in every frame and the movie looks and sounds incredibly smooth. The action scenes were perfectly in sync with the music Baby was listening to and that was a thing of beauty.

113 minutes of badass filmmaking, you sure know how it's done Edgar Wright.",5

This movie has kind of the same formula as the second movie, but I am tired of that. Also, after two movies, it's a bit far-fetched to have another villian who wants to steal a very special diamond.

"4467",338,"I had watched Despicable Me only so that I could finally understand what the whole deal with the minions was. But I ended up liking the movie and all the characters in that. As a result I decided to watch the sequel as well, which I ended up liking even more than the first one. So I thought why not just go all out and watch every single movie? And so I watched this one, and I really I think it was not something really great, although it did manage to do what it was meant to do: give us the laughs and have a good time.
Despicable Me 3 is about Gru finding out about his estranged brother Dru who is living a very rich life but does not have the evil nature of Gru and thus is not liked as much by his family. And so grew is forced to take his brother along with him to stop the evil villain Balthazar Bratt, a child actor from the 80s who has faded away with time. Although the minions in this movie are way less than the previous two I don't mind this at all. In fact I kind of found them annoying and I wanted more of the human characters than those yellow Facebook meme sources.
Balthazar is my favourite villain from this franchise. All his acts are very funny. Whenever he is on the screen you know you are in for some good time. There are often callbacks to his show which is very campy and has barred CGI according to today's times, which is just like how we see shows from the 80s today. He always dances and plays songs whenever he is out on the heist. It is fun to watch Gru and Balthazar fight in the opening scene and also the way Baltasar dances as he defeats all the guards on the ship.
The animation of this movie is way better than the previous two, especially when it comes to the action scenes and car chasing. What this movie lacks in however, is the amount of campiness and cliched moments of having an amateur person come out on a secret mission along with the professional friend/family member. In fact the whole idea of the protagonist having an estranged twin brother is a cliched idea which has been used many times in Bollywood films.
Although this isn't a very memorable movie, it does exactly what all the other movies from this franchise do. It is able to create a fantasy world with fun and loving characters who do goofy things and we enjoy them while it lasts. And this is the reason why I don't think this franchise should have more movies. By the time one movie comes we have already forgotten what happened in the previous one. Although I wouldn't say that this is a bad movie, I would definitely say that you would not remember anything other than the good parts once the movie ends, and this is the reason why this movie is so much fun to remember since I don't exactly remember what I didn't like about it.",4

"4473",344,"""The Little Hours"" is a fairly amusing movie, but I feel like it had the potential to be a hilarious piece of comedy gold. This movie had the goofy premise going for it and has the talented cast to back it up. I didn't really like it at first but there were some decent jokes scattered throughout. I thought one segment was actually really funny and it ended up saving the movie for me because until that point the movie failed to make me laugh out loud much.

The movie seems to lose a bit of momentum towards the end, or maybe the viewer just gets accustomed to the deviant nature of virtually all involved.

"4499",370,"Visually breathtaking and an exciting adventure.",5
"4500",371,"Climactic ending? Sure. Good movie? Eh, it was alright. A few things diminished my enjoyment of this movie to less than the first two. Firstly, the fact that the colonel didn't just kill Caesar right off the bat really bugged me. It wouldn't have been that much of a problem but his capture, though integral to his character arc, took way too much of the runtime and got less and less believable as time went on. Also the escape was too easy and didn't have any sort of tension or anything. Second, I was expecting something a little more tangibly climactic with the plot of this film. Yes, it was good to end on Caesar finally leading his people to a home of safety and it was pointed to realize that that was his purpose all along but aside from a line of dialogue here and there, I didn't pick up on the journey of the apes to a new home as one of much importance until the very end. That was my problem with this movie in general. More than it's predecessors, things just happen and they'll have a reason down the road but they don't have a logical reason to have occurred. I was expecting more than just a sequence of events plot. Even if the plot takes a step down, I think that the overall narrative remains true, even if the thematic elements aren't as clearly fleshed out. There were interesting new ideas (Novas, donkeys, and other signs of the worlds shifting) incredible new set pieces, the performances, visuals and digital effects were just as good as always and better but overall, the narrative punch was scattershot to me and had a weaker impact than the last two. Caesar stands out once again as the focal point but he can't hold this movie entirely together, it's become too big for him and maybe that's how it always had to be. The series outgrew it's main character on purpose and ended at the parting of ways. For me personally, it weakened the experience but I suppose, made for a better outcome. Caesar's journey is the natural last step in his arc but I was frustrated by the portrayal. It wasn't bad by any means I just didn't feel connected like I had before. The old familiar characters were there but it just didn't have the weight to me. I still loved Maurice. He was even more kind, more loyal and even more awesome and he didn't die in the end. This was truly an awe inspiring ending and overall a satisfying one but I suppose I wanted something a little more dynamic. I guess what we learned is leave humans alone and they'll kill each other. Run into the hills and be free. Ok then. I'll give this movie credit, it was quite an achievement. I just didn't totally buy it.",4

The owner reluctantly agrees but soon wishes he hadn't when the man starts manipulating his power.  How will the circus deal with the stranger?

John Harlow, director of My Lucky Star, The Agitator, Green Fingers, While I Live, Those People Next Door, and Dangerous Cargo, delivers The Dark Tower.  The storyline for this movie is extremely good, fascinating, unique, and unpredictable.  The setting is well depicted and the acting is wonderful.  The cast includes Herbert Lom, Ben Lyon, David Farrar, and Anne Crawford.

""Your intelligence surprises me.""

I came across this film while flicking through Turner Classic Movies (TCM) and decided to record it.  I couldn't pass on a movie with a circus plot.  I adored Herbert Lom's performance and found his character, despite being the protagonist, the most interesting and well done.  I definitely recommend seeing this movie if you get the chance and the end is perfect!

"4572",443,"Much forgotten macho action malarkey from the mid-eighties, courtesy of the prolific schlock-meister (and sometime Pro Wrestler!) Fred Olen Ray.
  Despite the supremely-evident budget constraints, we have stars David Carradine and Lee Van Cleef (""I'm your Pappy!"") as the central father/son duo - forced by Chinatown ne'er-do-wells into the titular (and none-too-reluctant) ""Armed Response"".
  The reliable Mako is the chief baddie (and one of the surge of villainous Japanese characters called 'Tanaka' of the era) and he's helped out in his evil-doing by ""The Hills Have Eyes"" poster boy, Michael Berryman. Yet even the maniacally bog-eyed Berryman ends up ruing the day he pushed lots of needles into Brent Huff's exposed torso: that's right, his badass bro' Dave Carradine is a Vietnam Veteran with a score to settle. And of course, him and his pisshead Pappy have guns. A lot of big guns. 
  ""Armed Response"" gets to its schlocky zenith in a poorly shot 'murder' scene  (that always strangely brings Russ Meyer to mind) in the desert featuring a gun-toting blonde and that great B-Movie stalwart, Dick Miller. I'd wager the movie would also form a pretty good drinking game given the amount of time spent in and references to ""the bar"" from the ever-immaculately mustachioed Mr. Van Cleef. 
   For those not allergic to meat-headed macho heroics from an era of ""Rambo""-esque jingoism, it is worth a blast. The over-riding ""You've messed with the wrong family!"" motto and undercharacterized Asian villains are unfortunately still alive and well in the recent ""Red Dawn"" 'reboot' fiasco.
   Olen Ray (under a remarkable array of pseudonyms) went on to produce, direct and star in many films with titles like ""Scream Queen Hot Tub Party"" and ""The Teenie Weenie Bikini Squad"". 
   N.B. How many genre movies place a hell of a lot of death and carnage on the retaining or recovery of a priceless Jade Statue?  Jackal Chan's Jade horse (ha!) in the bizarre ""Ninja Thunderbolt"" also springs to mind.",2
"4573",444,"There are two sides to every war. There are the chivalrous heroes and the treacherous villains. The honorable heroes include Burt Roth (Lee Van Cleef), and his sons, Jim (David Carradine), a Vietnam Veteran, Tommy (Brent Huff), and Private Eye Clay Roth (David Goss). This close-knit family will either go down fighting or stand together in victory.

Now, meet the bad guys. The ringleader is Akira Tanaka (Mako), the insidious mob boss who controls the Japanese Yakuza in Los Angeles. This antagonist gives new meaning to the word ""evil."" Then, there is F.C. (Michael Berryman), a gigantic bodyguard who is seemingly impregnable. When this guy gives you a fortune cookie, be afraid...be very afraid. Get ready to panic, for that is just a sign of heinous things to come...

The setting is the mean streets of Los Angeles's Chinatown. The object of affection is a priceless Jade statue. The Yakuza has intended to use this statue as a ""gift"" of reconciliation for the Chinese mob. However, after murdering one of his own perfidious men, Tanaka realizes that the statue has fallen in the hands of someone else. Tanaka wants this Jade statue back...and he is willing to torture any soul just to obtain that prized possession...

The Roth family realizes that after one of their own kin unwittingly clutches the Jade statue in his hands, Tanaka is targeting them for termination. They have no choice. The Roth family has only one option: WAR. The forces of good and evil will clash in a fists-and-firepower battle. The Roth family is prepared...the only proper response...is an ARMED RESPONSE...

One of the best attributes of Armed Response is its all-star cast. With favorites including David Carradine, Lee Van Cleef, Mako, Michael Berryman, et. al., Armed Response is armed with a terrific cast. The cast is glowing with talented character actors and actresses. Both David Carradine and Lee Van Cleef are capable as a father-and-son fighting duo who are bonded by courage, strength, and honor. Carradine may not portray the most poignant Vietnam Veteran, but at least his character still has intermittent flashbacks of the horrors of the Vietnam War.  Yeah, the Vietnam settings aren't really accurate, but give director Fred Olen Rey credit for trying.  Mako is great as the sadistically evil bad guy who is a master of torture! He may be an intelligent nemesis, but sadism is his true forte. Ross Hagen is cool as a backstabbing con artist who is posing as a detective. This guy is only interested in making a profit.  Laurene Landon and Dick Miller are amusing as a couple of thieves who are also weapons experts, mind you. Michael Berryman, best known for playing Pluto in the cult classic The Hills Have Eyes, plays it straight as Tanaka's right-hand henchman. Armed Response features some of the best exploitation veterans in this particular genre.

Armed Response is not bad for a B-movie. For a mere budget of probably not more then a couple million dollars, this film features a lot of explosive car crashes and high caliber thrills. Armed Response is reasonably fast-paced with a few expertly directed action scenes and stunts.  Cars flip over and explode with regularity.  Bad guys leap when they are killed in action.  Another redeeming factor is the film's mordant sense of humor. In a way, Armed Response satirizes on the action genre itself, poking fun at certain types of characters, behavioral mannerisms, and character stereotypes. This film also benefits by having a few genuinely funny moments, though some of the humor is of the grade school variety (e.g., Hagen's character quips that he shot a woman's tits off after shooting her in the chest during a shootout).  

Though Armed Response is much better than some of its B-movie competition, it is still, nonetheless, a low budget film with its defects. Though the cast is excellent, the material and plot are very simplistic. This movie is nothing more than a simple tale of heroes with a vengeance. There are a few attempts to deviate from the plot, but those are nothing exceptional. If only the characters and storyline had more insight, then maybe this movie could have been a more riveting thriller.  The Asian villains are also straight out of a Fu Manchu picture, and this movie doesn't exactly have the most glowing portrayal of Asians.  Though Tanaka has one of the best one-liners.  While interrogating one of the Roth brothers using ancient Oriental torture tactics, Tanaka remarks: ""Here we go once again...the evil yellow man torturing the valiant white hero.""  I got a good laugh out of that line.  I like how this movie makes fun of stereotyping Asian villains and that American jingoism can go overboard.  

If you want to see an enjoyable B-movie, then look no further. Your search has ended here. This is one of Fred Olen Ray's finest and foremost action films. Armed Response is definitely worth a Saturday night rental. Granted, some people may detest this movie's blatant jingoism, but the overall permeating silliness of this movie makes you glad that it was made strictly for fun. This movie does not demand to be taken seriously at all.

Armed Response is an unrealized action flick that did not deserve to be ignored by critics. Though this movie may fall short of being an ambitious thriller, it works perfectly as perfunctory, crowd-pleasing lunacy for action fans. Armed Response may be high calorie junk food, but there's nothing wrong with indulging yourself once in a while.

I'll see you at the bar.",3
"4574",445,"Average action film still represents one of Fred Olen Ray's better efforts.

"4577",448,"Pretty tv grade conflict between David Carradine, a bald, aging Lee Van Cleef and some asian godfather that tries to simulate elements of Miami Vice.  For instance, wet streets at night, neon lights, shootouts, sythesizer soundtrack.

A Japanese crime boss hires two private investegators, Clay and Cory Roth, to exchange ransom money for a stolen statue. The exchange goes bad and Clay is murdered as a result of foul play. His brother and father vow to seek revenge on the men responsible for Clay's murder, and they won't stop until they get every last one.

The shootout in the end is predictable and the grenade throwing David Carradine is as preposterous as the end of the crime boss after him.

Not a terrible film, still not approaching average either.

"4578",449,"Out of the hundred films schlock director Fred Olen Ray directed throughout the 80's, only a few really stood out and managed to liven up the entertainment value and experience. One such film was the over-the-top actioner Armed Response, where Ray was lucky enough to assemble of who's who of cult icons as the film's cast. Armed Response focuses on a heavily testosterone-fueled family comprised of matriarchal retired cop dad (the late great Lee Van Cleef) and his three sons, including Vietnam vets/bar owners David Carradine and Brent Huff, and private eye David Goss. When Goss gets caught up in a shady deal with partner Ross Hagen and the Chinese Yakuza (led by Mako) and killed over a precious statue, the entire family embarks on a journey towards serving up vengeance. To add to the film's already bedazzling cast, there are supporting roles from the likes of Dick Miller (Gremlins 1 & 2), Laurene Landon (Maniac Cop 1 & 2), Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Mortal Kombat), and Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes 1 & 2). As far as nudity is concern, it's skimpy (no pun intended). Luckily, I was graced with a brief titty shot from my ultimate 80's crush, Michelle Bauer. Aside from that, the movie is 110% pure, action cheese with over-the-top scenes of explosions, gunplay, and the occasion kung-fu. The entire cast is fun to watch in this film, especially leads Carradine and Cleef. As far as silly 80's, low-budget action movies go, this one provides the goods, especially if watching with friends and beer. Good stuff.",4
"4579",450,"A very well casted film. The action scenes are entertaining. It is cool to see David Carradine and Lee Van Cleef on the screen together. The fortune cookie idea was cool and the bomb placed on the statue. Many cameos are also in the film including Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Laurene Landon, and Dick Miller. Mako plays the bad guy and does a good job. Overall, the action scenes are fun to watch and I did like watching the actors and actresses work together.",5

"4582",453,"I like Safdie Bro's style. After Uncut Gems and Good Time, I still can't quite put my finger on it yet except for… sweaty? It's probably vapid at this point to say that Robert Pattinson is actually a really good actor, but Good Time adds another check for that category in my book. Constantine ""Connie"" Nikas (Pattinson) and Nikolas ""Nick"" Nikas (Benny Safdie), his developmentally disabled brother, rob an NYC bank, which quickly degenerates into a dye ink covered shitshow. I applaud the decision to not focus on Nick in jail, as it would've been too depressing. Instead, we get a high-octane, on-the-run thriller of Connie attempting to break his brother out of the clink. Brotherly love is always one of my favorite themes — having one being disabled and assaulted in Rikers adds a new dimension. The score is phenomenal. My favorite shot scene was the foot-chase shot from high up in the apartment building. *Side Note* I was pleasantly surprised to discover ""Necro,"" a rapper I used to listen to in HS played Caliph. I also loved/hated that Cellino and Barnes made a quick cameo. The style of the ending — credits included — I suppose was somewhat uplifting, but I don't think the Safdie Brothers really care about that, and that's okay.",5

Pattinson plays a criminal who robs a bank with his brother who is special needs and the bother gets arrested so it’s Pattinsons story as we see him deal with this and see what he does next.

"4590",461,"This is the kind of perfectly-paced, engrossing crime story Martin Scorsese used to tell.  It's told from the perspective of the criminals involved, giving the characters opportunities to develop and for their bad decisions to lead to their inevitable disastrous results.  Robert Pattinson proves he's a powerful actor, not just a pretty face - even as he plays a petty criminal who knows how to use his attractive power over women to manipulate and deceive them.   Benny Safdie doesn't get enough credit for acting, because his wholly believable portrayal is mainly unspoken, and his on-screen time is a fraction of Pattinson's.  Just the same, Benny's performance is an integral part of the satisfyingly grim whole.",5

"4593",464,"One thing I realized by watching this movie, Plaza can throw down with the best of them. She doesn't act, she inhabits a character.

Some times funny, I enjoyed the tongue and cheek commentary about social media darlings and how their lives aren't as 'perfect' as they make them seem.

Suicide should not be glamorized and the fact that Ingrid gets everything she hopes for by a failed suicide attempt just feels exploitative. I heard in an interview that the director wrote Ingrid based on her having borderline personality disorder and this kind of portrayal is why a lot of people with BPD don't get real help.

La sceneggiatura, per quanto inverosimile nei suoi legami, riesce comunque a tenere un filo sensato e a non far vedere in maniera troppo evidente le forzature che portano i soggetti ad avere rapporti tra di loro.

This movie was the very rare perfect mixture of comedy and horror. It had hilarious moments scattered about, but the movie didn't rely on them. It had an actual plot that was very interesting to follow and amazing character relationships. The acting was surprisingly great and realistic for the most part and I actually found myself getting attached to some of the characters by the end. There were also at least 5 quotable lines that I was ready to put on a shirt lol.
The editing and line delivery really made the movie for me. The timing of jokes and their delivery was just *muah* and when this was paired with editing that unexpectedly cut people off mid-scream, it was perfect. I went back multiple times to get a laugh at the same jokes.

(Mauro Lanari)",3
"4635",506,"""All Saints"" is based on a true story about an Episcopal pastor, Michael Spurlock, whose first assignment is to close a church that has dwindled down to only a handful of members.  His mission is to spend a couple of months doing an inventory, assist potential buyers, and shepherd the remaining members elsewhere.  The All Saints church is located in a rural community in Tennessee and the remaining members aren't anxious to leave.  As things are winding down, the congregation is surprised by a group of Karen refugees from Burma who have escaped a brutal civil war.  Several Karen families, who were Christians before they fled Burma, are struggling to survive and have turned to the All Saints church for assistance; unfortunately, there is no money or resources to share with them since the church is closing.

In an effort to sustain themselves, the Karen, who were farmers in Burma, ask pastor Michael if they can plant crops on some of the land that surrounds the church.  Michael agrees but believes the church might be sold before they are able to harvest their crops.  As Michael works through the problems that God has brought his way, he comes to the conclusion that there is enough land attached to the church to turn it into a farm that can sustain the Karen families and pay the church mortgage.  After a struggle with the church hierarchy, Michael is allowed to take the church off the market and move forward with his plan to turn the property into a profitable farm.

The first season of farming is a major struggle and it looks like the concept is going to fail; however, in the end the church hierarchy sees the potential and decides to support the church/farm financially in order to help it succeed.

This is a richly textured story about a man who leaves his sales career to become a pastor, and a community that learns to adapt to a new situation in a remarkable way.  It is also a story about how God may choose to work things out in ways that are not always easy to understand.  ""All Saints,"" is a well-made film with quality acting and was filmed at the actual All Saints church which today is a thriving ministry.  The concept of repurposing a church rather than closing the doors is one that should be considered more often.  God's work is not always carried out through a worship venue; sometimes a farm works just as well.",4

As a veteran myself, I am thankful for this story, to show that we served too, and women in the military are badass, willing to step up and get the job done and still want to feel pretty and be taken seriously.  As a former homeless veteran, I appreciate that this film talks about the sad side of returning from service and what women often have to endure long after leaving.",5

The moments we witness with these women are extraordinary, powerful, heartwarming, and heartbreaking. From the first time we see all these women together at the pageant's finals in Las Vegas, we understand that the tiara is not the highest stakes for those involved. Love, acceptance, support, and recognition are all higher priorities for these women, and it is a final gratification to catch up with these women after the competition is over in a last series of the small moments and big triumphs that make up their lives. These women are absolutely remarkable and inspiring and so is this film.",5

He takes a coward's way out and as the movie ends we just get to watch him feel bad about it and watch fireworks...no resolve, no arc, this will be his pitiful and cowardly life according to this film.

"4663",534,"Such a confusing exercise for all involved. Not surprised that it wasn't released for three years after shooting. Waltz is the only cast member who delivers in the slightest. I like Vikander, but her character is remarkably uninteresting and the main romance laughable. The tulip sidelines do nothing for the plot, apart from providing conveniences. Clearly, the incorporation of tulip investing was only an attempt to make the rest of the film seem like less of the sex-for-exposition, weak period drama romance that it was. What are Judi Dench, Zach Galifanakis, and Cara Delevingne doing here in throwaway roles? The latter less so at this stage of her career, but surely the other two had better things to be doing. Every time that Waltz is on screen, you feel the pain and good nature of his character to your core, but this only serves to further accentuate the deficiencies in plot and performance elsewhere and angers me that such a force could be so wasted on a horrific project. The additional sideline of Holliday Grainger as a pregnant maid and the resulting harebrained subplot involving the main character convolutes things further. Dane DeHaan is awful. The main romance between him and Vikander does nothing, but he never, at any point, inspires any emotion but vague distaste. Likewise, the climax and ending is at best puzzling and at worst a complete massacre of the very art of cinema. The setting of period Amsterdam reads like someone who picked out a few facts from a book and hired costume designers to do the rest, rather than detailed historical knowledge. In fact, the whole story reads as if someone watched one film in their life, made a few notes, and then attempted to create their own with no revision.",1
"4664",535,"Disappointing. I wish I'd read a review before watching it so I didn't get my hopes up. I love period dramas and forbidden love and what a stellar cast. Except for the 2 young romantic leads! Why were they cast? How could this film be so bad?! Rubbish story. Who read this story and thought that it was good? How did they manage to get so many big names basically play bit-part extras? Mind-boggling. Was it meant to be a comedy perhaps? But not funny?",1
"4665",536,"Despite a great premise about the Tulip trade in 17th century Amsterdam and love affairs, the writing is uninspired and anticlimactic with messy plotting.

"4670",541,"Contrary to the more disillusioned critics, I think this was a good movie. Tulip Fever is a cautionary tale of love and greed, paralleling an adulterous affair with the tulip buying craze of the 17th century.

The main problem is that neither theme was developed fully enough despite having nearly 2 hours to do it. The affair and the flower fad both end disastrously but a little more attention to why both started was ignored, leaving the viewer suddenly immersed in a whirlwind of ever increasing drama without fully understanding why.

The film is beautifully shot. Every scene looks like a painting from a Dutch master. The characters are interesting and the use of a maid's voiceover as narrator was compelling and interesting. But then the entanglements begin.

The main characters, Sophia and her older, rich husband seem very happy. He has taken her from a convent and lavished her with wealth. However, the problem of infertility of Sophia's side is soon revealed but her husband doesn't mind and says so to different characters. Sophia seems content to, despite the rather routine ritual of lovemaking, which doesn't seem that awful either. We never quite figure out why she was so bored. Anyway, one day her husband hires a young stallion of an artist. Then the infatuation and love affair begin.

While Sophia is deep into her affair, her maid has also fallen in love with a local fishmonger. They plan to marry and he gets involved with tulip speculation. He sells a prize bulb for a huge sum. On his way to break the good news to the maid, he sees Sophia having relations with her lover but thinks its his fiancee, the maid. Upset, he ends up at a tavern where he is robbed and immediately conscripted into the Navy. Meanwhile, his beloved has no idea where he went.

Once she realizes she is pregnant, she blackmails Sophia who decides to pass off the maid's kid as her own, then fake her own death so she can sail away with her artist boyfriend. Sound crazy enough? The artist also gets into tulip speculation and makes a huge profit. Unfortunately, his drunken friend thinks the valuable tulip is an onion and eats it, bankrupting his friend.

That's a lot to take in. Even more than Judi Dench as a pipe smoking, wise ass Mother Superior, skilled in tulip valuation.

The plan almost works perfectly except the maid's boyfriend returns from sea, confronts her about her ""affair"" which she denies and shows him their daughter. Sophia's husband overhears the whole thing and rather than firing her or trying to find his wife, he signs over all of his property to her and her boyfriend and sails for the East Indies.
 
If you got through all that you'll realize that way too much was going on. While all these twists were interesting, they seemed to veer too far off the path and feel too complicated for what's basically a foolish wife's ridiculous plan against a good husband.

Still, the film makes for interesting post-viewing conversation. Tulip Fever fails to get your blood boiling  but it will keep your mind going in circles.",4

(2012) Home Again
DRAMA

  Sensationalized dramatization regarding three departees blacklisted from Jamaica as a country.  It first makes a footnote regarding the percentage of Jamaican immigrants immigrating to other first world countries before failing us to engage it like another ""Crash"" or ""Babel"" movie with multiple characters intertwining with one another.  It basically showcases one character from each country, in this instance it's Canada, The United States and Great Britain solemnly reveals why these three in particularly, were deported back to Jamaica again and branded as criminals that can't be trusted, in which their lives don't get any easier.  One of it's major problems is that the stories feel very imposed which shows us their lives without much thought since much of it almost seemed that their information about them can be collected by a newspaper or by on-line.

The other two clergyman admittedly are a bit extreme as foils to one another, and thus feel less genuine, in spite of the actors' display of talents. But this hardly takes away from the naturalistic dialog, the leads' charisma and shifting moods and tones, and the marvels of Spicer's see-everything face (which fits perfectly with his character.)

I left the Catholic church in my late 20's. 1. Because I think confessing to an imperfect priest is stupid and ridiculous. We in my town had an alcoholic Priest, sent away somewhere was pretty young maybe 12. I see many gay priests now which distresses me and don't understand. Can't find that in the Bible. I don't Judge, only God can Judge us. I don't do Gossip or Malicious Gossip. God, Jesus states the 10 commandments, which I try hard to live by. 

I have seen so much Hypocrisy in my home town church, disgusts me. Calling themselves good Catholics. God will judge them and Karma in life will get them too.
I found my Joyful all nomination Church here. Based on the Bible, Father God, Son, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. Faith very strong, in the Trinity and Bible. Even that has errors.

wrong. IOW, don't not see the film because of it. It's neither a

religion except maybe why don't we all just sit down and start over.
All four primary characters are superbly cast, including Danny Glover
who is about 3 steps above anything I've ever seen him in before. The
subject matter is handled respectfully, albeit with liberal amounts of
humor which zeros in on the fact that most religions take themselves
way to seriously--which the production company apparently takes to
heart, naming itself Pigasus (sic) Pictures.


This is about as perfect as you can expect an independent film to be.
It's only flaw is there being too much lipstick on Daniel--which is so
obvious, I wondered if they just wanted to give the audience something
to criticize. Needless to say, there's no actual action for the action
junkies, but the dialogue and the subject matter are outstanding--and

"4700",571,"Gun Shy (Eric Blakeney, 2000)
[originally posted 22Nov2000]

It's utterly amazing to me, even after so many examples of it, that a film containing A-list, top-of-the-line B-list, and excellent underrated actors can still miss the mark so widely, but there it is.

Gun Shy is Eric Blakeney (Baywatch, Generation X)'s big-screen debut, and casting-wise, at least, he pulled out all the stops. Liam Neeson is a DEA agent who's become disenchanted with his job, and it's turned him into something of a neurotic. He's assigned to go undercover to sting the mob, and he meets a similarly neurotic hit man, whom he befriends (Oliver Platt), while falling in love with, yes, his enema nurse (Sandra Bullock) and trying to achieve rapport with his support group.

Sound like a cute comedy? It could have been. Or a decent thriller, playing the mob-infiltration angle. Human drama? Well, maybe not, given the enema-nurse angle, but it might have managed a stab in the right direction. Romance? Maybe. Combine any two of those and you may manage a serviceable movie; comedy-action thrillers have been all the rage since Lethal Weapon. But even that vaunted team couldn't add a third element and keep it working correctly (did anyone really like Lethal Weapon 3?). Not surprisingly, Blakeney comes up with a mess that looks like someone attempted to cook spaghetti, with sauce, in a pressure cooker that exploded. Pass on this one. Really. *  1/2",2

"4707",578,"Amazing, a true testament to what officers endure mentally and physically and the families we have supporting us.",5
"4708",579,"As a current law enforcement officer and a husband and father to 3 amazing sons. I want thank you for making this film and sharing too the world the reality we face everyday, the unknowns, the career that is done everyday as we are called to do so. A path not done by many and easily criticized by many. I respect the way you made the lives of the officers that have  come to life and speak to me and family. You have made me more aware to make every day count more with them and I appreciate the support and love we do get from some even in these hard times our society faces of divisions and hate towards us. Prayers to all the men and women in blue and let's keep moving forward and as told in movie ""go on"". From houston tx we support this film 100% will continue being that light and face evil for those that can't.",2
